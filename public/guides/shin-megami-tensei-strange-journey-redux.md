## Frequently Asked Questions [SJ_FAQ]

---

Q: What kind of game is this?

A: First-person dungeon crawler. I know, I know. This turns a lot of people off of the prospect of playing it.

---

Q: How long is this game?

A: Despite being on a portable platform, this game is as long as pretty much any decent length console RPG out there. 50-90 hours for your first play through the game, depending on how much of the things available you decide to do. There are 3 endings and over 300 demons to register if you want to complete the compendium or replay the game.

---

Q: How do I fuse `<insert demon here>`?

A: This isn't a Fusion FAQ. For your fusion needs, I would recommend you check out Zeruel's excellent Fusion mechanics and demon database guide, also available on GameFAQs like this guide is.

If you need specific demon + demon recipes, there is the fusion calculator over at http://apps.evilrobotstuff.com/strange_journey

---

Q: Is there anyway to skip dialogue? Reading hurts my brain.

A: Hold down the X button.

---

Q: Do you have a password for `<specific demon>`?

A: Again, this isn't a fusion FAQ. However, in the future I may add specific demon passwords to parts of this guide as a means to helping you, the reader, complete the game if you get stuck using your own demons and they don't seem to be cutting it against the tougher bosses.

---

Q: Is there some way to game the system and keep my demon sources? Getting them a second time is like winning the lottery...

A: Yes. Using the password input system, you can fuse up a demon, register it and output the password, then reset your game to before you fused the demon (and therefore used the source) and input that password to get your final demon. Costs money, but the good demon sources are more valuable than a relatively small amount of money, really. Here's a step by step guide to that:

- Save your game before you do anything. Before you pull components out of your compendium or any of that.

- Fuse your demon up. Use sources, mitamas--spare no expense. You won't be saving your game and won't lose what you use.

- Make sure that after your demon is fused, you REGISTER it into the Compendium. Now output its password and write it down.

- IMPORTANT! DO NOT SAVE YOUR GAME. Now reset or reload your save from earlier, before you spent the sources or money or anything.

- Input the password into one of your Compendium's Register Password slots, and then buy the demon out of the compendium.

You obviously still have your sources used to make that demon.

---

Q: Why is this game rated M?

A: Your guess is as good as mine. Probably the ESRB just looked over it and said "Well, this game is in a series that is mostly rated M so let' slap an M on it and call it a day." It certainly doesn't have any real "graphic content."

---

Q: My / your / someone else's demon password(s) do not work!

A: There's many possible reasons for this. The password could be invalid... but, more likely, you entered it wrong. Keep in mind, passwords are case sensitive AND there's a lot of characters that might confuse some such as O and 0, x and X, S and 5, G and 6, etc. When writing down or using passwords, make sure you carefully look them over.

It's best to view passwords in a fixed-width font, so if you're copying them off of say, the Atlus USA forums or the GameFAQs forums or most other messageboards for example, just copy and paste them into a text editor using a fixed-width font and you should be able to tell the difference between the look-alike characters.

---

Q: Can I use the password system to get restricted fusion demons that I have not yet unlocked?

A: Yes, but it costs you a lot more Macca. It can be useful though if you want to get say, Seraph, so you can get Seraph source on the Neutral path and make demons with the Big Bang skill or whatever, though. There are some skills that only come from certain demon's sources.

---

Q: Yo! Where my freeze/shock at?

A: There's no secondary status ailments attached to elemental spells in
this game like in many previous SMT games.

---

Q: What are the official passwords for the password-only demons?

A: Here you are:

Megami Ishtar [51]
ISHTAR FIGHTS
TAMMUZ ANGELS

Vile Alciel [61]
ALCARMOR

Fairy Demonee-ho [75]
You can't laugh
OR cry now!

Jirae Bagaboo [20]
Special Password
+Bagaboo

Jirae Bogaboo [20]
Special Password
+Bogaboo

Jirae Bugaboo [20]
Special Password
+Bugaboo

Fake Demonica-L [1]
Special Password
+Law

Fake Demonica-N [1]
Special Password
+Neutral

Fake Demonica-C [1]
Special Password
+Chaos

---

Q: How do I tell what my current alignment is?

A: Just like with demons, the color of your name shows your alignment.

Blue = Law
White = Neutral
Red = Chaos

---

Q: Is there any way to change / manipulate my alignment?

A: Yes! After completing at least one of the Faerie land establishment EX Missions and reaching Eridanus story-progress wise, look for a goblin just west of the High Pixie who gives out the Faerie land EX Missions. Keep trying to talk to the goblin until you get dialogue options. You'll get two sets of options.

```
(Goblin is digging a hole, but something seems to be preventing him from
digging deeper...)

> What will you do?
> Watch (Neutral)
> Help (Law)

(Goblin seems to have found something...)
"Ooh, lucky me! I found something!"
> Good for you. (Neutral)
> Hand it over. (Chaos)
```

By answering Law + Neutral, or Neutral + Chaos, you can set your alignment to whatever you want before your alignment is finalized in the last dungeon or to get EX Missions that may require specific alignment. You will have to do this many, many times to see the alignment change, however, as it is just a small shift. In fact, if you wanted to go from just turned Chaos to just Law or just turned Law to Chaos, it would take 18 opposite-alignment answers to shift all the way to the other alignment.

The chance of the dialogue options appearing seems to be a percentage equal to your main character's Lu stat.

The chance of the dialogue options appearing seems to be a percentage equal to your main character's Lu stat.

Chance = X% where X = Lu stat value. In New Game+ / second cycle, the chance is supposedly (X+15)%

---

Q: How do I get past that one door in Phase Shift Sanctum A of Grus?

A: New Game + / Second Cycle, bro.

---

Q: Is there an ultimate boss in this game like many previous SMT games?

A: Yes. New Game + / Second Cycle only just like in most of them, too.

---

Q: What carries over in New Game+ / Second Cycle?

A: The following things:

- Your Macca
- All Consumable/Expendable-type Items (example: Life Stone, Bead, etc.)
- All Equipment - Swords, Guns, Armor, Accessories.
- All Base and Assist Forma.
- Demon Compendium, excluding passwords entered into the password slots. This includes the rest of the "Demon Data" menu including the Analysis and the data about demon sources that you've collected, but not the actual source items themselves. If you want to make good custom demons, do it before you create a clear save and use your sources up.
- Unlocked Demon Fusions. You can also fuse demons of a level higher than your Main Character in a New Game + or summon demons of a higher level than yourself out of the regular Compendium slots. However, this does not apply to Password demons which you must still be at or above the level of to summon.
- Completed "Records" achievements and progress towards them, except for the specific map floors which do not save partial coverage--only full. Maps themselves are wiped clean when you begin a New Game+.
- You have 12 demon storage slots at the start of the game instead of 8.

Some new EX Missions are unlocked, a few new Sub Apps and Accessories are unlocked at the Lab, and you can get into the other half of the Grus dungeon via the Sanctum A area of Grus 1F.

Also, although Demon Source items do not carry over, it does seem to "reset" them so that you can get them again on the first levelup from a demon with a maxed analyze gauge. This is good because the chance of getting a source after the first is pretty low normally.

---

## Game System Information [SJ_SYS]

---

### Stats

There are five basic stats in this game. They are:

`St` - Increases damage done by physical and gun-type attacks. Note that all of the Main Character's gun-type attacks, including those that would otherwise be considered elemental magic, are actually influenced by this statistic and the gun's innate attack power value. Not so for demons.

`Ma` - Increases damage from demon's magic-type skills and increases defense to magic attacks. Just because it doesn't increase the main character's attack power doesn't mean it's not needed, though. You don't want to get one shotted by magic. Also increases max MP by 2 per 1 point in Ma. The main character also gets part of his damage reduction from the Defense value of his armor.

`Vi` - Increases defense to physical and gun attacks. Also increases HP by 3 per 1 point in Vi. The main character also gets part of his damage reduction from the Defense value of his armor.

`Ag` - Largely determines acting order in a turn. However, the main character is a special case when he uses an Item. He will always go first when he uses an item.

`Lu` - Luck... Helps determine hit/miss rates, probably item drop rates. It can't hurt to have high Lu.

There is also "Level" as a statistic in most Megaten titles, and this game is no exception. It generally increases attack powers/defensive values by a bit per level, but in this game has the dubious distinction of also affecting Hit/Miss rates making going through the game at a low level pretty much impossible.

---

### Resistances

Like most Megaten titles since Nocturne, this game has the resist system. Basically, you and every demon you have as well as every enemy out there have innate resistances. What they are determines how effective each type of element is. These are displayed in the status screen.

`Wk` = Weak. Target takes 150% damage from attack, or has a 150% normal chance to be hit by Expel and Curse skills.

`-` = No resistance. Target takes regular damage and has regular chance to be hit by Expel and Curse skills.

`St` = Strong. Target takes 50% damage from attack, or has a 50% normal chance to be hit by Expel and Curse skills.

`Nu` = Null. Attack does not effect target.

`Rf` = Reflect. Target reflects the attack to the attacker. Unlike most Megaten titles, however, Reflect here works differently. When an attack is reflected in Strange Journey, the target will take damage as if they had a "-" in Resistance, regardless of what their actual resistance to the reflected attack would normally be. So even if they're strong, null, reflect or drain the attack normally, they will take full damage in this game's system. Rf is very useful in this game.

`Dr` = Drain. Target is instead healed by the attack.

There are 8 elements that you or a demon can have a property in one of the above resistance types to. They are: Phys, Gun, Fire, Ice, Elec, Wind, Expel, and Curse. The 9th type of attack, Almighty, cannot be resisted.

A demon's resists can only be changed by fusing skills which alter them onto the demon.

The Main Character's resists are determined by what piece of armor he has equipped. Each piece of armor has differing resist types. He has an innate Null Expel unless the armor modifies this, and whatever piece of armor he wears may add additional weaknesses, strengths, or nulls to his resistance list.

It's a good idea to buy as many types of armor for him as possible, and to equip them as needed for specific fights.

---

### Demon Co-Op

Demon Co-Op is the "gimmick system" of SMT: Strange Journey. Nocturne and DDS had the Press Turn system, Persona 3 and 4 had the knock down/extra one system that was sort of based off of the Press Turn system. Is it better than Press Turn? I'd say no.
Strange Journey has this Demon Co-Op system.

So what is Demon Co-Op?

Well, when you or a demon hit an enemy's weakness, all other same-alignment party members will perform an extra attack that does Almighty damage. However, if there are no other party members of the same alignment as the attacker who hit the weakness, no Demon Co-Op will take place.

Note that Demon Co-Ops only take place when you hit an enemy Weakness. It's not like the press turn and variant systems where a critical Phys attack would also work with the system regardless of whether the enemy was weak to Phys or not.

The alignment used is the Law-Neutral-Chaos Axis, not the Light-Neutral-Dark alignment axis. You can tell where your main character or any demon you have falls into this system by their name color.

Blue = Law
White = Neutral
Red = Chaos

The damage is based upon the Level, St and Ma stats of the character and/ or demon(s) who perform the Co-Op attack and how many allies participate.

1 ally produces : (ally #1 co-op damage) x 1.0
2 allies produce : (ally #1 + ally #2 co-op damages) x 0.75

### Alignment

Alignment plays a sort of important role in this game.

Compared to previous SMT titles with actual alignment systems, here...

- Compared to SMT and SMT II, you can use all alignments of demons,
  regardless of your current alignment. In SMT and SMT II, you could not use
  opposite-alignment demons; Law could not use Chaos, and Chaos could not
  use Law. Here, you can use any alignment you want. No problem.
- Like other SMT titles with actual alignment in them, here it helps to
  determine your Ending.

- Is important in determining usage of the new Demon Co-Op system.

Demon Co-Op attacks are restricted to same-alignment character and demons only. You don't need to have your demons as the same alignment as your main character, though. Demons will still Co-Op with other demons who are the same alignment as themselves.

Again, as above in the Co-Op section explained, the Light-Neutral-Dark axis of alignment has nothing to do with Co-Op. It is the Law-Neutral-Chaos axis that determines Co-Op. Light-Neutral-Dark has to do with negotiation. Dark demons simply won't talk to you, while most Light demons don't even show up in battles to be recruited and will have to be fused.

It's easier to recruit same alignment demons through negotiation, though this hinges on the Law-Neutral-Chaos axis.

You can easily tell what alignment your main character or a demon is by the color of their name.

Blue is Law.
White is Neutral.
Red is Chaos.

You cannot change a demon's alignment.

As for affecting your main character's alignment, read on.

When using the Walkthrough, note that throughout the walkthrough there are points where alignment questions are posed. An important note is that choices marked (Neutral) do not actually move you towards Neutral. They simply keep you where you currently are.

If you are Chaos and want to go Neutral, you must answer with Law answers until you go Neutral. If you are Law and wish to go Neutral, you must answer with Chaos answers until you go Neutral. This is "gamey" of course, but it is what it is. Why does it work this way?

Think of alignment like a scale, like so:

![Alignment chart](https://i.imgur.com/EM7G3vw.png)

Answering Law adds a positive amount, while answering Chaos is a negative amount added. Getting Neutral is a sort of zero-sum game. If you're wondering how I got the 17 total point Neutral scale, well, it's from using the alignment manipulation trick to see how many times it took to answer to go from the very beginning of Law to Chaos and then back from Chaos to Law. 18 times. I assume that the manipulation trick uses the absolute lowest point value for responses, while the actual story question values are probably much larger. Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon alignment worked similarly, really.

Which brings me to the next point, the manipulation trick itself. It is displayed up in the Frequently Asked Questions area of the FAQ, but In the interest of not making you scroll up, I'll add it down here too.

After completing at least one of the Faerie land establishment EX Missions and reaching Eridanus story-progress wise, look for a goblin just west of the High Pixie who gives out the Faerie land EX Missions. Keep trying to talk to the goblin until you get dialogue options. You'll get two sets of options.

```
(Goblin is digging a hole, but something seems to be preventing him from
digging deeper...)

> What will you do?
> Watch (Neutral)
> Help (Law)

(Goblin seems to have found something...)
"Ooh, lucky me! I found something!"
> Good for you. (Neutral)
> Hand it over. (Chaos)
```

By answering Law + Neutral, or Neutral + Chaos, you can set your alignment to whatever you want before your alignment is finalized in the last dungeon or to get EX Missions that may require specific alignment. You will have to do this many, many times to see the alignment change, however, as it is just a small shift. In fact, if you wanted to go from just turned Chaos to just Law or just turned Law to Chaos, it would take 18 opposite-alignment answers to shift all the way to the other alignment.

The chance of the dialogue options appearing seems to be a percentage equal to your main character's Lu stat.

Chance = X% where X = Lu stat value.
In New Game+ / second cycle, the chance is supposedly (X+15)%

### Status Ailments and Battle Parameters

#### Battle Parameters

First, an explanation of battle parameters.

If you press the Y button while you're at the in-battle menus, you can bring
up a display that looks a bit like this for each character in battle:

```
 _________
| Atk  -- |
| Def  -- |
| Ag   -- |
| Prot -- |
| ___     |
||   |    |
||   |    |
| ¯¯¯     |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
```

These display battle parameter changes.

Atk increases or decreases the target's attack power for all attacks when it is modified by spells.
Atk is affected positively by spells like Tarukaja and Luster Candy. Negatively by spells like Tarunda, War Cry and Debilitate.

Def either decreases the damage taken or increases it when it is modified by spells.
Def is affected positively by spells like Rakukaja and Luster Candy. Negatively by spells like Rakunda, Acid Breath and Debilitate.

This "Ag" battle parameter is really Hit/Evasion chance. Ag is affected positively by spells like Sukukaja and Luster Candy.
Negatively by spells like Sukunda, Fog Breath and Debilitate. This has nothing to do with the actual stat, Ag.

Each of these parameters can be lowered to a minimum of -4, or increased to a maximum of +4 by these spells.

Atk will add 12.5% extra damage done by the character per +1, to a maximum of 50% added at +4.

Def will decrease the damage taken by 12.5% per +1, to a maximum of 50% added at +4.

Ag will increase the chance to hit and evade from its normal value 12.5% per +1, to a maximum of 50% added per +4.

Conversely, -1 to -4 parameter changes work the same way. 12.5% decreases per -1, to a maximum of 50% at -4.

The "Prot" property simply displays whether or not the Tetraja effect is active on a character. You will see a white circle if it is. Otherwise --. Tetraja protects against one Expel or Curse-based instant kill before it disappears from the character.

The box below Prot displays an icon of a status ailment, if the target is currently afflicted by a status ailment.

Take this box as an example:

```
 _________
| Atk  +3 |
| Def  -1 |
| Ag   +2 |
| Prot () |
| ___     |
||   |    |
||   |    |
| ¯¯¯     |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
```

In this example, the character deals 37.5% more damage due to +3 Atk.
The character takes 12.5% more damage due to -1 Def.
The character hits and evades 25% more often due to +2 Ag.
The character is protected by Tetraja.
The character has an empty status ailment box, and so is not afflicted by
any status ailment currently.

#### Status Ailments

These are the status ailments in Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey:

##### Death

Demon's HP reaches 0. It returns to stock and is dead until resurrected.
When resurrected, the demon will still need to be resummoned into the
active party unless it is resurrected in-battle via the Invitation spell.
Obviously does not go away after battle.

If the main character's HP reaches 0, it is game over unless you have
the Dragon Ring equipped which can save you once per battle like the
demon skill "Enduring Soul" does for demons.

##### Poison

HP decreases once every turn or tile of movement on the field.
This effect does not go away after battle.

##### Strain

MP decreases once every turn or tile of movement on the field.
This effect does not go away after battle, but may disappear after a
turn during battle.

##### Paralyze

Target cannot evade and their defense drops, making them take more damage.
They will also occasionally lose their turn.
This effect does not go away after battle.

##### Sleep

Target is asleep and unable to act. Regenerates a very tiny amount of HP and
MP per turn while sleeping, and should they be hit while sleeping will take
much more damage than they normally would. A sleeping character also cannot
evade an attack. A sleeping character is also eligible to be instantly killed
by the Eternal Rest spell.
This effect does disappear after a battle ends.

##### Mute

Target cannot use any spells or skills.
This effect does not go away after battle.

##### Charm

Target loses control and will attack random allies using the basic Attack
command. Wears off naturally after several turns or after battle ends.

##### Stone

Target is turned to Stone and cannot act. They will take less damage but
cannot be healed. If the Main Character becomes petrified, it is game over.
This effect does not go away after battle.

Null Curse seems to prevent this effect on the Main Character, but as for
demons it is up to the individual demon's ailment resistance properties.
These are hidden but Zeruel's Fusion FAQ/demon database has them documented.

##### Fear

Target will randomly lose their turn. A demon affected by this will
randomly return to stock as well. Wears off after several turns or
when the battle ends.

##### Bomb

Target becomes a living bomb. If struck, the target has a 50% chance of
exploding, killing them and dealing damage equal to current HP to all of
their allies. If the target uses the Defend command, the chance becomes
0% while defending. Wears off at the end of battle.

##### Rage

Target loses control and will use the basic Attack command on random targets
which can include allies--but not themselves--and will do increased damage.

---

### Demon Negotiation

This is a description of the flow of how demon negotiation works in this game. With this info and a bit of experience, you should be able to use the system to your advantage.

There's several types of negotiation. First, I'll go over the basic type:
When you select Talk in a battle and select an enemy demon.

#### Basic "Talk" Negotiation

To begin, you cannot talk to demons who are "Dark-" aligned, except when
they initiate the conversation or it is a full moon and you use the Lunatic
Sub App. However, these are distinctly different from regular negotiation
and I'll go into them later. You also cannot talk to Enemy Search specific
enemies. Everything else you meet in a random encounter however, is fair game.
Except of course, when the Moon phase is a full moon, but again I will get to
that later as the mechanics are different.

When you successfully initiate a conversation with a demon, you will be
given some dialogue including the note about your possible alignment
differences and then a choice of 2 or 3 response options.

The alignment note affects two things...

First, how many items/things the demon will ask for when you ask it to
be your demon, and how much Macca it asks for when it asks for Macca during
that facet of negotiation. Also, how much HP/MP they drain when they ask for
that. Same alignment demons ask for less things, less Macca and drain less
of your HP/MP when they ask for that. Opposite alignment demons ask for more.
If you are neutral or the demon you are talking to is neutral, they will
generally ask for a middling amount.

It also affects the chance of a demon deciding to not join you after you've
met their demands when asking them to be your demon.

Anyway, on to conversation.
The responses that the demon likes or dislikes are based on...

A) The demon's personality type.
B) The specific-demon itself.

For example, a demon of the Jack personality type (Fairy Jack Frost,
Fairy Pyro Jack)... will generally act like this when you get this
3 response question:

"What's a hee-human doing here, ho?"
• Adventuring. <- Generally likes.
• Research. <- Does not like, and will run away.
• A social studies trip. <- Generally does not like.

Many demon personalities have two response questions where they ask
you to come close to them. The Jack personality one is...

"Hee-ho! Come closer, ho."
• Get closer.
• Keep your distance.

Generally, for these across ALL personality types, the "Get closer" option
will be a positive response, though there is a small chance they may attack
you (enemy gets free attack round) and end the negotiation.

And then there are specific responses that, within a personality type, are
liked more by a specific demon and hated by others.
For example again, with the Jack personality...

"Doesn't that scare you, ho...?"
• It does. <- Generally dislikes.
• Not really. <- Generally likes.
• Mascots don't scare me. <- Jack Frost likes this and will force itself into
your party, but Pyro Jack hates it and attacks!
Do I detect jealousy for his frosty friend?

Another example, from the Girly personality.

"By the way, why'd you talk to me?"
• I want you to be my demon. <- Generally likes.
• I want stuff from you. <- Generally dislikes.
• Because you're charming. <- Lilim likes this, but Leanan Sidhe and Lilith
for example do not and will attack you.

You need to pass two questions to get to the negotiation phase.
Generally, across the same personality type, demons like the same responses.
This takes some experience on your part to figure things out. However,
there is a small random chance that the normal liked answers anger the
demon. All you can do is suck it up and deal with it.

Once you know the generally liked responses through trial and error, you can
negotiate your way to the phase where you can ask for stuff almost every time
if you're using the Relax Spray Sub App that allows 1 error.

Anyway, unliked answers; An unliked answer can result in three things:

• The demon likes your answer: Go to next question or ask what you want if one
question has already passed.
• The demon does not like your answer. There are different possibilities here:
• Does not like it, but may forgive you randomly of their own choice.
Note that if you have Relax Spray Sub App equipped, them forgiving you
this way doesn't count towards Relax Spray's usage!
• Does not like it. If you have the Relax Spray Sub App equipped, they will
forgive you once per negotiation. If they do not forgive you, the
negotiation is over. You cannot talk to this demon for the rest of the
battle, though if for example you are in a battle with 3 Jack Frosts, you
may talk to the other two Jack Frosts. When a conversation ends negatively
this way, the demon will either randomly leave the battle, not leave the
battle and dump you back at the combat selection menu, or will get a free
attack round on you. Negotiation can be dangerous.
• Does not like it, and infact hates it! Demon party gets a free attack
round. This type of response cannot be smoothed over with Relax Spray.
• Does not like it, and is disgusted/scared by it like for example telling
the Girly personality that you don't like women, or Jack personality that
you're here for Research. The demon will leave the battle being
"disgusted/scared". The battle doesn't end if there are other demons,
however.
• After two questions, the demon may decide it likes you and give you an
item and then leave, skipping the whole negotiation bit.

Battles only end automatically when a demon joins you or gives you something.

Normally, after two questions are answered, you will get these choices:

> Main Character and the demon are on friendly terms.
> • Try negotiating.
> • Stay quiet.

Selecting "Try negotiating" generally moves you onto the 4 option choice
below, while "Stay quiet" generally makes the demon do one of two things;
Give you an item or macca, or heal you or you and your demons and then leave.

If you select Try negotiating, the demon rarely may get angry. Relax Spray
can fix this if it's equipped and not been triggered yet in this negotiation
session. Usually, things will go fine and you will get the below choices.

> What will your request be?
> • Be my demon.
> • I want an item.
> • I want Macca.
> • I don't want anything.

> Selecting "Be my demon." will prompt the demon to ask you for things.
> It may be to drain your "vitality/life" (HP) it may be to drain your spirit
> (MP), it may be for curative/restorative items, it may be for Macca.
> It may be a ridiculous request for hundreds of thousands to millions of Macca
> or an Incense, but your response to that doesn't matter as it was just a joke
> on the demon's part and even if you say yes it's not going to make you give
> it to them, even if you have it.

Alignment affects how many times they ask for things and how much they ask
for -- Opposites ask for more, same alignment asks for less, and Neutral
asks for a middling amount, always, even if you too are Neutral.
Opposite alignment will drain more HP/MP for you and ask for larger sums of
Macca. Same alignments will take much less than normal.

You may refuse a demon 2-3 times of a requested thing before they get angry.
Relax Spray Sub App--if not triggered yet in this negotiation--can fix this
if it happens. Otherwise, the demon may forgive you themselves. If not, the
negotiation ends as normal and the demon may leave or attack or just end
the conversation telling you to get back to fighting them.

If you meet the demon's demands in full, the demon will either...

... Join your party. If you have a "Garnish" type Sub App equipped, they will
then give you whatever that Sub App prescribes. They are now in your demon
stock. The battle ends. IF your demon stock is full, the demon will leave
the battle but will "remember" you. That is, if you open up a slot in your
demon stock, you can simply talk to that demon next time you meet them in
a random battle and they'll join you automatically, once.

... Decide to not join your party. Chances are higher for opposite alignment
demons. If you have the Tea Amity Sub App equipped, they will reconsider
and join your party 100% of the time when this happens, and if you have
a Garnish Sub App equipped, will again give you whatever that Sub App is
supposed to make them give you. If the demon does not join you, it will
leave the battle and the battle does not end if there are still more
demons in battle. If the demon joins you via Tea Amity of course,
the battle's over.

> Selecting "I want an item." causes the demon to give you an item.
> The battle then ends, with the demon leaving the battle.

No questions asked, no strings attached. You just get an item.
The "Extra Item" Sub App causes them to give you a second item when
you get an item from a demon in almost every way including by them
just choosing to give you an item on their own.

> Selecting "I want Macca." causes the demon to give you some Macca.
> Higher level demons give more Macca. The battle then ends, with the
> demon leaving the battle.

No questions asked, no strings attached. You just get some Macca.
The "Extra Macca" Sub App causes them to give you a second sum of Macca
when a demon chooses to give you Macca in almost every way including by
them just choosing to give you some Macca on their own.

> Selecting "I don't want anything." has random results. The demon may simply
> call you a weirdo and leave battle. They may heal you. They may give you an
> item. They may give you Macca. Sometimes, rarely, they may give a GOOD item.

... and that about covers the basic negotiation as initiated by the player
with the in-battle Talk command.

• > Full Moon Negotiation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now I'll go over Full Moon negotiation. During the Full Moon phase, you cannot
talk to any demon unless you have the Lunatic Sub App equipped. However, if
you equip this Sub App and talk to them...

You will enter a nonstandard negotiation with the demon where they
ask you a question with two responses.

The chance of each response getting a positive effect is about equal, really.
When liked, the demon will give you an item or Macca and then leave, or may
join you. It's random.

When unliked, the demon will leave the battle, cancel the negotiation,
or get a free attack round.

That's really all there is to Full Moon negotiation. The only upside to it is
that it lets you talk to Dark- aligned demons.

Now, there are two types of "Initiated by demon" negotiations. They are:

• > Demon initiates: Beginning of battle...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The "Green Grass" Sub App increases the chances of this happening.

You can...

• Ask them to be your demon.
• Ignore them.

If you "Ask them to be your demon" there is a high chance that they will
join you and the battle will end. However, they may call you a fool and
attack you. It's a bad idea to ask them to be your demon if your HP is
low when this happens, obviously. Note that if you have the Green Grass
Sub App equipped, the chance of them faking you out is 0% -- they will in
other words always join you. Useful. If a demon joins you, the battle
will automatically end.

If you ignore them, the result is the same. They'll either tell you that
you're dense for not knowing that they wanted to join you or they'll
act surprised you "saw through their trap." What happens however is the same,
the demon leaves the battle and the battle does not end if there are still
more demons left.

• > Demon initiates: Mid-combat, afraid of you...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The "Light in Hell" Sub App increases the chances of this happening.

You can...

• Let it go.
• Stop it from going.

If you "Let it go" it will do one of three things.
One, it will simply say thanks and leave. You get nothing.
Two, it will say thanks, give you an item and leave.
Three, it will say thanks and join you.

If you Stop it from going, it will give you an item and then leave, or it
may attack you. Though only demons who are left by themselves will choose
to beg for their lives so there isn't much threat in stopping them unless
your HP is low, or something.

That's pretty much all there is to negotiation.

Being successful with demon negotiation is just a matter of learning the
patterns of acceptable responses within personality types and of course
using Sub Apps such as Relax Spray, Tea Amity, Green Grass, and Light in Hell
to your advantage. It's less complex than in other titles such as Raidou
Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon, but it's less random as well.

There's also a small matter of gifts for when you successfully talk to demons
of certain personality types a set number of times. Successfully talking
meaning, getting past the first 2 questions you're asked and to what
would normally get you to the negotiation stage.

The number of successful talks does not reset when you start a New Game+,
but when talking to a new personality for the first time in a New Game+,
you get the message that says it's "your first time hearing a demon that
speaks like this" which makes it seem like it does.

> Compendium Password System <
> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

In Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey, players can use and create passwords
for custom demons using the compendium functions associated with passwords.

How does it work? When you use the "Output password" function in the
View Compendium section, the game will spit out a password.
If you're writing these down, make sure to look carefully at the password
as to not confuse any somewhat similar looking characters such as o, O and 0.

Players can use passwords by using Compendium -> Register function and
scrolling to the bottom and using one of the three password slots.
There are only three slots, but if all are full you can overwrite whichever
one you want by just registering over it.

Selecting Register in a password slot brings up a small keypad which you can
use to input the password. Passwords are of course case sensitive, so make
sure you enter them correctly. You can enter them using the Stylus if
you wish, and pressing the X button is a shortcut to changes the current
character set from upper to lower case and back.
If a password is entered in full correctly, you will see the demon's data
and be asked to confirm the registration. If not, you will get an invalid
password error.

To condense things, here is how you:

Output a password for one of your own custom demons...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
• First, make sure you Register your custom demon in the Compendium.
If the demon is not registered to its current status, you will not get a
password for the current, desired demon.
• Select Demon Data -> Demon Compendium -> View, then scroll to the demon.
Open up the menu and select "Output password". Again, make sure that the
demon data you are viewing is the Custom Data, not the Original Data, else
you won't get the password you want.
• The game will spit out a 2-line password. Write it down carefully.
Share it with people or use with the source-saving method.
Maybe go crazy and test it first to make sure it works. Might help.

Use someone else's password...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
• Select Demon Data -> Demon Compendium -> Register. Scroll to the very bottom
where the password slots are. Select one of the slots marked "PWD" and then
choose to input a password for that slot.
• Carefully look at and input the password. If you get an invalid error, you
may have entered it wrong or it may be an invalid password. Confirm the
password in full and try again, and if it doesn't seem to work then chances
are it's an invalid password.
• After the password has been successfully registered and you have confirmed
to store the demon in that password slot, go into
Demon Data -> Demon Compendium -> View, and scroll down to that password
slot which the password was inserted into. You can now use the functions
of the slot to summon that demon out. For a price, of course.
To summon a password demon, you have to be at or above the level of the
demon in question, even in a New Game+.

> Main App <
> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
> Main App is the functionality of the Demonica that is always activated once
> you acquire each specific function.

Proximity Alert
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Basically, a random encounter meter. It goes from blue, to yellow, to red.
You begin with this and it has no upgrades.

Forma Search
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Allows you to find Forma out on the field. There are three ranks of this
App. Rank A displays Red Forma. Rank B displays Silver Forma, and Rank C
displays Gold Forma. Each has differering contents. Forma Search A and B
are gained as required story progress objectives.

Forma Search C is optional and comes from a Rare Forma which is a reward
from the EX Mission "Catch the rabbit!"

Unlock
¯¯¯¯¯¯
Unlocks the locked door portals you may come across. Different ranks unlock
different colored doors.

There are five ranks. Unlock A, Unlock B, Unlock C, Unlock D, and Unlock E.
Unlock E is optional and comes from a Rare Forma found in Grus 1F, original
space. You need Gate Search E to get at it-- it's in the northwest part
of the map.

Gate Search
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Allows you to open secret door portals. There are five ranks of this, as
well. Gate Search A through E. Gate Search E is optional and comes from
a Rare Forma from the EX Mission "Marebito, the foreign god."

Enemy Search
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Like Forma search, except for enemies. With this, you can find tougher
enemies and enemies that can't be found elsewhere. They usually drop nice
items in addition to unique forma, though most do not give experience points.

Many demons found via Enemy Search are restricted fusions that cannot be made
until you defeat them in battle. However, extremely tough enemies known as
Fiends may show up rarely...

There are three ranks of this Main App, A through C. Enemy Search A and B
are gained as required to progress through the story, while Enemy Search C
is optional and found in the southeast corner of B4F in Horologium.

Phase Shifter
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Shifts you over to a different dimension in a small pocket area. This can only
be done at the special space manipulation devices, and is needed to progress
in various parts of the game after it becomes available.

There are two ranks, each bringing you to different areas. Both ranks of this
are found as required to progress the story.

Visualizer
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Visualizes dark areas, giving you a rough 3D visual on the geometry of the
area, essentially allowing you to see in the dark. However, you still cannot
see the map tiles fill in. This just allows you to navigate.

There are three ranks of this App, each of which will visualize a different
type of dark area. They're all technically "optional" though it is difficult
to traverse certain areas without them.

A lights up the Blue areas, B lights up the Red, and C lights up the Yellow.

Rank A is found via Rare Forma in the east part of 4F Delphinus.
Rank B is found via Rare Forma in the northeast part of 1F Jack's Squad HQ.
Rank C is found in B6F of Horologium, in the southwest area of the map.

Walkthrough: Introduction [SJ_WALK-INT]
/******************\*\*******************\_******************\*\*******************\
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

A NOTE ABOUT THIS WALKTHROUGH:

I'm not going to tell you what demons to use. This is entirely up to you.
I generally just tell you what skills you should be using when it comes to
the boss fights.

I DO provide pre-made password demons for all difficult boss fights,
however note that these passwords are provided as-is and will probably be
expensive as all good password demons are. They are custom-made to kill
the bosses, generally, though many of them have a somewhat versatile skillset
that can also be used to crawl the dungeons.

They are there for those who get stuck and really have no clue how to fuse
or don't have proper sources and just want to move on, but you still have
to earn the money to buy them and be the proper level.

¯¯¯
Select to begin the game and watch your scenes, and you'll eventually be
prompted to enter your character's name. Do so.

The choice after naming yourself to shake Commander Gore's hand affects
alignment. Your very first alignment choice, in fact.

> Commander Gore held out his right hand... What will you do?
> • Shake his hand. (Neutral)
> • Refuse to shake. (Chaos)

After the scenes you'll be dumped into the menus in the ship.
You can talk to other crewmembers if you'd like or save your game.

If you talk to Zelenin in the command room here, you can get yet another
alignment-affecting choice.

> Extend your hand to Zelenin?
> • Yes (Law)
> • No (Chaos)

What you'll need to do is select "Move" from the menu and select to go to the
Deck area of the ship, then select Yes to go to Commander Gore's briefing.

You'll enter another lengthly scene where you meet a notable crewman, Jimenez,
and learn about the DEMONICA - DEMOuntable Next Integrated Capability Armor.
Yeah, that's a mouthful and doesn't make perfect sense--but whatevs--and you
will be given a sort of questionnaire that will determine your initial
statistics and your stat-growth type.

¯¯¯
• Question #1

"You are the sole survivor on a battlefield. You are hidden, with no
ammunition in your pistol. You detect a single enemy approaching.

How will you deal with this enemy, equipped with only an empty gun?"

• 1: Ditch the gun and use a knife.
• 2: Search for ammunition.
• 3: Stay hidden until he passes.

¯¯¯
• Question #2

"While infiltrating enemy territory, you spot the man who killed your
comrade and closest friend. You can kill him easily, but the gunshot will
expose you and your infiltration will be compromised.

Will you avenge your friend or focus on your objective?"

• 1: Do nothing, for the mission.
• 2: Kill him, for your friend.
• 3: Find a way to do both.

¯¯¯
• Question #3

"You have been in a remote area on a mission and your relief has not arrived
on schedule. You can abort the mission and go home now, but you have enough
supplies to stay here longer.

What do you do?"

• 1: Wait as long as it takes.
• 2: Wait as long as you can.
• 3: Go back immediately.

¯¯¯
• Question #4

"You are piloting a helicopter to refuel. En route, an ally under attack
requests help. You can help him, but it will take your remaining fuel, and
it will be difficult to leave afterward. Other pilots have also received the
distress signal, but you are the closest to his position.

What will you do with the fuel you have left?"

• 1: Hurry to rescue him.
• 2: Refuel and let an ally take him.
• 3: Land nearby, wait for allies.

¯¯¯
• Question #5

"On a mission in occupied territory, you are asked whether to capture a
religious leader who may be a spy. Catching a spy may be a great achievement,
but the people may riot if this leader is captured.

How will you approach the religious leader suspect of spying?"

• 1: Keep watching him for now.
• 2: Bring him in immediately.
• 3: Put him under house arrest.

¯¯¯
• Question #6

"You have been sent to the Schwarzwelt, where conditions are expected to be
harsh. Yet you have advanced equipment, a strong ship, the latest tech, and
dependable comrades.

Will the Schwarzwelt investigation mission succeed?"

• 1: Yes. <- The game forces you to input this answer for this question.
• 2: It's impossible.
• 3: I don't know.

Again, the game will just ask the question again until you input answer 1
for this question.

¯¯¯
Depending on your answers, your DEMONICA"s stat-growth type and your initial
stats are now set. Only questions 1-5 actually matter, obviously, since Q6 is
a classic "... But thou must!" moment.

Strength-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Attack support"

Answer Questions 1-5 with the first choice.

Percent chance growth rates are...

St: 24%
Ma: 18%
Vi: 19%
Ag: 20%
Lu: 19%

Initial stats:
56HP, 32MP, 7 St, 5 Ma, 5 Vi, 6 Ag, 5 Lu, 22 MeleeAtk, 15 GunAtk, 21 Def

Magic-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Technical support"

Answer Questions 1-5 in this order: 3, 1, 3, 2, 1.

Percent chance growth rates are...

St: 19%
Ma: 24%
Vi: 19%
Ag: 20%
Lu: 18%

Initial stats:
58HP, 37MP, 5 St, 7 Ma, 6 Vi, 5 Ag, 5 Lu, 20 MeleeAtk, 13 GunAtk, 22 Def

Vitality-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Physical support"

Answer Questions 1-5 in this order: 2, 1, 1, 2, 2.

Percent chance growth rates are...

St: 18%
Ma: 19%
Vi: 24%
Ag: 19%
Lu: 20%

Initial stats:
63HP, 32 MP, 5 St, 5 Ma, 7 Vi, 5 Ag, 6 Lu, 20 MeleeAtk, 13 GunAtk, 23 Def

Agility-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Speed support"

Answer Questions 1-5 with the third choice.

Percent chance growth rates are...

St: 19%
Ma: 20%
Vi: 18%
Ag: 24%
Lu: 19%

Initial stats:
55 HP, 35 MP, 5 St, 6 Ma, 5 Vi, 7 Ag, 5 Lu, 20 MeleeAtk, 13 GunAtk, 21 Def

Luck-type
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
"Luck support"

Answer Questions 1-5 with the second choice.

Percent chance growth rates are...

St: 19%
Ma: 19%
Vi: 19%
Ag: 19%
Lu: 24%

Initial stats:
60HP, 36 MP, 6 St, 6 Ma, 6 Vi, 6 Ag, 7 Lu, 21 MeleeAtk, 14 GunAtk, 22 Def

All in all, it doesn't really matter what you choose. This is a pretty minor
choice, to be honest. The level-up stat-ups are random and the chance for
stats to be distributed in any given stat is of course a percentage-based
chance based on the growth types. There are other choice combinations that
result in the above growth types as well, but those are ones I've confirmed
to work.

I chose the Luck-type, because, well, I like more frequent item drops, and it
is pretty balanced in distribution chances with Luck being the highest.
Of course, this could just be me being superstitious. Who knows!
Anyway, even as Luck specialization I didn't end up with Lu as my highest
stat, to show how random it is.

You'll be sent documents you can review on your DEMONICA.

• Document: Schwarzwelt Investigation Team
• Document: Mission Log
• Document: Alignment
• Document: Demonica

Read them if you wish--you'll be in the ship navigation menu again. Talk to
Jimenez and the crewmembers if you wish as well. Talking to Jimenez gets you
yet another alignment-affecting choice.

> Offer Jimenez a handshake?
> • Yes (Law)
> • No (Chaos)

Afterwards, select move and go to the Command Room to progress the story once
again. Talk to everyone there, then move to the Deck once again.

More scenes, leading to the four ships entering the Schwarzwelt.
A question will be asked by a crewmember during one of these scenes, and it
affects alignment:

"Feeling relaxed, are we?"
• I've been trained. (Neutral)
• Deep down, I'm praying. (Law)
• I'm not afraid to die. (Chaos)

In the following scenes, a mission will be added to the log, as well as a
document about the Misson Log.

• Document: Mission Log
• Mission: Engineering SOS

Read them if you wish, and talk to the crewmember at the Command Room if you
wish as well. You can save, too. After you're done, Move to the Deck.
More scenes will commence and you'll receive the Demon Summoning Program, and
be sent into battle automatically with unknown enemies.

Simply use your Gun's regular Gunshot attack a few times to win the battle,
since it hits all enemies. Note that when you meet any new regular enemy,
they will always display as unknown like in this battle.
The "Engineering SOS" Mission is complete after the battle.
After this, more scenes and a new Mission added.

• Mission: Sickbay Trouble
• Document: Demon Summoning Program

When you regain control, your next objective is to head to the Sickbay part
of the ship. Go to the Lab first, though, and Crewman Chen will give you
[Medicine x5]. Plus a new document. Heal yourself up and head to Sickbay.

• Document: Demonica Display

Another battle takes place here, with yet more Slimes. Gun them down the
same way you did the last time. Your DEMONICA should level up here.
The statistics are automatically assigned, unlike previous SMT games where
you had a choice of where to distribute them. The Sickbay Trouble mission is
now concluded, as well. A new document is added, too.

• Document: Demon Analyze / Unknown Demons

Yet more scenes! And another main Mission added.

• Mission: Missing Crewmen

When you've gained control again, it's time to actually begin exploring
the Schwarzwelt. You can now use the Sickbay to be healed, and go to the Lab
to restock on items-- Crewman Chen will give you [Medicine x10] right now.

Head to the Deck to begin the next part of the game. You can now choose to
enter Antlia, the first sector of the Schwarzwelt available to you. Do so
by selecting "Disembark" here at the Deck and then select Antlia.

Note: Enemies marked "Enemy Search ..." can only be found when you have
acquired the matching lettered Enemy Search DEMONICA function.

- Antlia 1F

A new Document will be added. It'll tell you the controls to navigating in the
3D dungeon field.

• Document: Field Controls

Most directions I give in this Walkthrough are based on Compass directions.
North - East - South - West. Learn them if you don't know them. Seriously.

Head north to meet a Strike Team member who will give you some more info on
basic knowledge you need to play the game, then head north through the door
to automatically enter a battle.

Here, in this battle, the Pixie will teach you about Demon Negotiation.
This isn't like a real negotiation, she's just a friendly demon teaching you
the ropes. Ask her to be your demon when the choice appears.
She'll tell you about the kinds of things demons will ask for in negotiations.
She'll also tell you about how alignment affects negotiations.
Finally, she'll tell you about negotiation with unknown demons.

She'll ask if she can be your demon, so there's no reason to not accept her.
Fairy Pixie will join you. Make sure to go into your DEMONICA menu and add her
to the active party. She'll send you a document about all of this, too.
Make sure to recruit all of the demons you can from now on. You'll need them.

• Document: Demon Conversation
• Document: Summoning Demons

Make sure to summon her in Party -> Summon before you continue. You'll have
someone to heal you and do some extra damage. Quite useful!

Now you can begin exploring the dungeon. To the west of your immediate
location is a treasure box with [Chakra Drop x1].
Back east and then south of the door you entered this area from, you will
find Crewman Irving at the dead end and he'll head back to the ship's Lab.

West and north of the entrance door in the main part of this area at the door
you will automatically enter a battle where Demon Co-Op attacks are explained.
After you win, you get a new document.

• Document: Demon Co-Op

Head west through the door beyond where that battle was fought and you'll meet
a Strike Team member who'll send you more info about Demon Analysis.
Go west from there and meet a Crewman. Choose to save them, and win the
easy random battle. It's Crewman MacCleary and he'll send you a document
about moon phases.

• Document: Moon Phases

In the north end of this room is a treasure box with [Revival Bead x1].
Grab it and head back into the main entrance room, then take the door in
the north end of the room. In this area, you find another crewman, Muccino.

Navigate west, then south in the hallway to the dead end, and turn west to
open up a treasure box with [500 Macca]. Now head back into the main part of
the room and to the east side and find a small path heading south to some
ice boulders and another crew member, Maebe. Choose to save her from the
demons, and win the battle. The Missing Crewmen mission will now be completed.

Head out of the dungeon via the way you came in to get back to the ship, as
Commander Gore asked. You can't do anything else here anyway as the odd doors
with the markings on them can't be unlocked as of yet.

A new mission will be added inside the ship:

• Mission: Rescue Jimenez

If you talk to Kato on the deck, he'll give you an alignment altering
question...

"Should I stop him?"
• Rules are rules. (Law)
• There are exceptions. (Chaos)

Save your game and head over to the Sickbay to heal up. Then go to the Lab if
you need more Medicines. It'll cost you now, though. Next, head back out into
Antlia via the Deck. In Antlia, you'll meet Commander Gore who's now part of
the Strike Team. He'll mark a spot on your map.

To get to it, we'll need to do some navigation. Head on over to where you saved
Crewman Maebe at the ice boulder wall. Commander Gore and the Strike Team will
blow it up, revealing more area to explore. After the scene, head south and then
at the first fork, go all the way east to reach a door with an emblem on it.
It is a terminal. Enter it. You can save your game here, or teleport out of
the dungeon. Useful.

North of the terminal is nothing but dead ends for now, so you'll need to head
south of it and take the south-east path. At the southmost point here you will
find a Heal Spot, at which you can pay Macca to heal your party. It costs the
same amount as the Red Sprite's Sickbay it seems.

East of the Heal Spot's location is the spot that Commander Gore marked on the
map. Before you go in, however, you may want to be level 5-6 with a full party
of 4. Fire spells are a plus. A party with Pixie, Knocker, and Tangata Manu as
your demons will suffice. In fact, I believe all of the other demons you can
encounter up until now are Dark aligned and thus you'd have to be a pretty
lucky skunk to have any of them in your party. Once you've got your party
assembled and ready, go save your game at the terminal and then head to
the door right before the marking on the map. Of course, make sure to use
the Heal Spot on the way there. Enter the door.

Scene where Gore gets his ass kicked later, and it's time for the first boss
of this Strange Journey, Orias of the Fallen clan.

---

< Boss: Fallen Orias >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 250 / MP: 130 ]

> Wk: Fire / Nu: Expel, Curse <

This is a very straightforward battle. All Orias can do is attack you, and
although he hits fairly hard, you will be able to outheal any damage he can
do to the Main Character with items or the Pixie's Dia spell.

Your main source of damage should be the Fire Shot gun attack from your
Main Character and the Pixie's Agi spell, both of which will trigger
Demon Co-Op attacks from all Neutral aligned characters in your party.
That being all but Tangata Manu, who is Law aligned.

Knocker and Tangata Manu can just use normal attacks or Tangata's
Needle Rush skill. It doesn't matter much though since neither will
really contribute much damage. Simply slug it out with Orias and heal
via Medicines with the MC or Dia from Pixie when needed.

If you're level 5-6, this'll be cake and over in no time.

¯¯¯
You'll get [Lemegetonite] after the battle, and the Rescue Jimenez mission
has now been completed. Your Lemegetonite will automatically be taken for
Crewman Irving to analyze during the scenes.
You'll also get an alignment question from Jimenez.

"Tell me, what's it gonna be?"
• I'm sticking it out. (Law)
• I'm out of here. (Chaos)

A new Mission will be added, issued by Arthur.

• Mission: Engine Restoration

After the scene, talk to the various members in the areas of the ship
if you wish and heal up. Blair on the Deck can tell you more in-depth
info about Demon Co-Op. Then head into Antlia once again.

Make your way to the save terminal near where you fought Orias, and
from it head north and follow the path east to come to where the
wrecked ship was. Basically it is on the other side of the ship
from where the Orias battle took place. It's the wrecked Blue Jet
ship. A scene will take place here if you choose to search.

In the scene you'll get the Tokamak Motor and CU Terminal.
Once again, head back to the base ship, the Red Sprite.
The Engine Restoration mission is now complete.

When you regain control, head into the ship's Lab.
Your DEMONICA will be upgraded with the Forma Search A ability.
Documents will be sent to you about this all, as well, and a new
main Mission.

• Document: Forma Basics
• Document: Main App
• Document: Forma Search
• Mission: Collect Rare Forma

Forma is basically materials used to make new things.

Talk to Crewman Chen to learn more about the whole deal.
Next, save your game, heal up and head back into Antlia once more.

Upon entering, you'll meet a generic Strike Team member and get more
info about the Forma Search function you'll need to use for this mission.
Review any materials and then continue on.

There are two ways to get the Forma. Killing or negotiation with demons,
or by picking them up on the Field with Forma Search.
All you can do is explore areas you've already been to and look for Forma.
That's the basic mission right now. Their locations are random, so just
walk around the floor and pickup what you can. You'll want to find Forma
until you stumble upon a rare one named [Feather Flock]. Irving will then
request you bring it to him.

Back at the Red Sprite, head into the Lab. The mission Collect Rare Forma
is now completed. Irving will give you the [Unlock A] App. You can now unlock
some of the doors with emblems in the dungeon. You'll get a document about
Sub Apps and be called to the Command Room by Arthur.

• Document: Sub Apps
• Document: Unlock

A scene will play and you'll get a new mission. The Demon Fusion function is
now available, as well. And a question from Jimenez about what you think
about demon fusion.

"Think you'll have fun with fusion?"
• Yeah, I can't wait to start. (Chaos)
• I'll use it if I need to. (Neutral)
• You should be careful. (Law)

• Mission: Energy Signature Investigation
• Document: Demon Fusion Fundamentals

Visit the Lab for possible new items from your collected Forma, including
equipment and Sub Apps. The following Sub Apps will now be available:

Hyakutaro, Hiroemon, Lunatic, Relax Spray.

If on a New Game+, these will also be available:

Red Carpet, Frost Icon, 7-Card Hand, New MegaTen.

Save your game and do your basic maintenance stuff then head back into Antlia.

The Unlock A app will let you unlock the doors with the green markings on
them.

Take the path west from the entrance room and unlock the door in the southwest
part of the floor, and head through it. This is a fairly linear path that leads
to a dead end with [Agilao Stone x1] in a treasure box in a large room. Head
back now.

Take the door in the northwest. Not the northmost door as that has a yellow
symbol and can't be unlocked yet. It's just a loop around to a one-way door
to an area you've already been, but you might find Forma here.

From the terminal near Orias, which you should save at and note that you can
now change Sub Apps at a terminal, head north and unlock the door there.

It leads to stairs down to the second floor.

- Antlia B1F

A new floor, with new demons. Head west and at the fork you'll hit an event.
A Fairy will request you give her a Bead since she's all beaten up. Accepting
will open up an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: The little injured faerie

From now on I'm going to simplify directions excepting the case of things
like teleport mazes, dark areas or other things that are just not easy to
navigate.

The south path at the fork leads to a door. Go through. There's a Heal Spot
in the northwest part of this room, a terminal in the northeast, and a bunch
of locked doors scattered all over. Behind each of the doors, the appearance
of the dungeon changes and stronger enemies are found. Proceed with caution.

Take the eastern door to begin. It's a linear pathway which you may find some
Forma in, but nothing of note. Back at the big room, take the south path.
You can find a Strike Team member on this path who will send you a document.
North side of this area has a treasure box with [Revival Bead x1]. The east-
most part has stairs down, so work your way west. You can meet another
Strike Team member there who will tell you more about fusion and the
compendium function.

• Document: Raising Demons / Demon Sources
• Document: Demon Compendium
• Document: Using Demon Sources

Oh, and another terminal just beyond him. In the west end is more stairs
heading down, so just explore the rest of this area. You'll find a treasure
box with [Chakra Drop x2] and probably more random field Forma.
Get back to the entry room with the Heal Spot and explore the west now.

You'll find a treasure box with [Patra Stone x2] in this area, and otherwise
this is a dead end area. You now have two choices on how to proceed...
Down the stairs in the southeast or southwest parts of the floor.

I'd recommend the southeast for now.

- Antlia B2F

The East end is literally a dead end in which you can find a dead Strike Team
member and maybe a random Forma. Head back up to B1F and take the western side
stairs down this time.

You'll immediately be presented with a fork, doors east and west in this new
area. Take the west for now. You can find a Sandman demon here which will
give an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Sandman's backup bag

Now go back and take the east doore You'll run into a fixed battle with a
Brute Oni. Nothing you can't handle. He does mention a Master Morax, however.
After you win, a Strike Team member shows up and gives you some random Forma,
[DF Antlite x1] and [Jaki Bolt x2].

Continue on to reach a fixed battle with a Fallen Melchom and Brute Oni.

No swag for winning this time, but you can continue on past them into the
door. South of there you'll find a treasure box with [Bufula Stone x1].
Another fixed battle awaits further in, versus Brute Oni with Beast Kaso
and two Fairy Pixies. Continue on afterwards.

You'll reach an area where a powerful demon is detected. A Strike Team
member will send you a document with a demon password. Make use of the
Heal Spot in this room, and the Terminal. Save. Unfortunately, the Strike Team
member's demon is utterly worthless. Try the one I listed below if you need
a healer for your team.

I recommend you explore the outlying areas to find [1000 Macca], and
[Revival Bead x2] in treasure boxes. Fuse up and/or recruit some demons that
are around your main character's level for the upcoming boss, which is just
obviously beyond the northern door.

Ideal equipment is the Andersen gun and Ancient Vest, if you've got the
forma for it.

Here are some password demons for the boss, if you're having trouble.

Beyond the door is the next boss, once you're prepared.
He'll ask you a question before the battle.

"Aren't demons the real heroes?"
• You have a point. (Chaos)
• Not at all. (Neutral)
• Both races are wrong. (Law)

Then you will have to fight.

< Boss: Tyrant Morax >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 700 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Ice / St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Fire <

Morax uses Maragi often, so you may wish to de-equip the piece of armor that
gives the Main Char a weakness to Fire as that's just going to end up causing
you much pain. Other than his Maragi, he uses a spell called Gehenna which
can cause the Fear status effect to any member of your party. Fear can cause
a loss of a character/demon's turn or make a demon return to the stock and
need to be re-summoned.

He can also use some semi-powerful phys strikes "Lunge" a single target Phys,
and Horned Rampage, a random target, possible multiple hitting Phys... but
these aren't much of a threat compared to the former abilities.
If you're having trouble, summon up the password demon above and use its
Sukukaja to help your evasion/hit rates. Jack it up to +4 since early
bosses including Morax don't know Dekaja.
The password demon can also heal. Having another demon with Media could help,
as well, but probably unneeded.

You could use Ice attacks if you've got a same-alignment team for offense, but
chances are you don't and if you do they don't have ice attacks unless you've
been doing way too many fusions up until now. He's not very difficult, anyway.
I just used non-fire elemental attacks and my regular attacks from the main
character while using Cursed Lance sword that hits twice.
Morax only has 700 HP.

Just be around level 10-11 with level 8-11 demons and recent equipment and it
will not be a problem to win this fight so long as you don't go in as Weak to
Fire or something stupid like that.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Morax fusion is unlocked.

You'll also get the [Brass Horn] key item and [Energy Mass] key items.
You'll automatically return to the Red Sprite afterwards.
The main mission Energy Signature Investigation is now complete.

- Bootes 1F

Look out for the red floors when proceeding, they will damage your party when
you step on them, so avoid stepping on them except when you need to in order
to proceed. Southeast of the entrance you can find and talk to a friendly
demon Melchom who will offer you an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Melchom's task I

Explore the open areas and note the "portals" at some dead ends where you
can examine walls that you can't open. In the southeast you can meet a
Karasu Tengu who has an EX Mission for you as well, to find Koppa Tengu.
Go ahead, do him a solid if you're bored.

• EX Mission: Long nose in the air

In the same general area of that Karasu Tengu you'll be able to meet
three demons named Dis on the field. If you talk to all of them they'll
give you a new EX Mission if you accept. You don't have to go to where
they want now, but you can't die from this even if you do. You'll even
get a free accessory and a full heal for your party for accepting this and it
opens up an EX Mission later on in the game.

• EX Mission: The madness of Yggdrasil

In the southwest area you'll find a generic Strike Team member who'll
tell you about the Records menu and send you a document about them.

• Document: Records

North of that location, you can launch a Signal Beacon that Arthur
gave you earlier.

Now in the northeastern end of this floor you can find a terminal and the
second launch spot for a Signal Beacon.

The main mission Bootes Monitor Duty is now completed, and Arthur requests
that you return to the ship. Before you do, make sure you fully explore the
areas available and get the rare Forma [Release Jewel]. It's found in a small
room in the very northeast end, north on the map of where you launched the
second Signal Beacon. Return to the ship to continue the story.

A new mission will be added in the ship.

• Mission: Emergency Signal Inquiry

Head on over to the Lab to give Irving the Release Jewel, which will add
the new App [Gate Search A] to your DEMONICA. This one lets you go through
some of the gate portals at the dead ends inside Bootes. The ones you
cannot access are of course for different gate search types.

• Document: Gate Search

Save your game and do your usual ship stuff then head back into Bootes.
You'll note when exploring that Crewman Norris is acting weirdly.
The portals are basically another type of door. When you run into Norris
in the central part of the floor, a new main mission will be added, as well.

• Mission: Search for Norris

Directly north of where you met him is a portal which leads to the "Palace"
area he was talking about. It's of course another area which the appearance
and enemy lineup changes. The other portals in the area you can open are
just shortcuts and empty rooms. Map out the one in the southwest though as
an EX Mission takes place there and it's good to have map knowledge in that
EX Mission.

You'll now want to explore the palace area. It's full of damage floors
so try to take the paths that have the small 1 tile damage floors to pass
rather than 3 to 5 in a row. The northwest part of the floor has a heal
spot while directly north of where the Terminal is you can find some stairs
going up and an inoperable elevator.

The Heal Spot should help you map past all of those damage floors. Once you
have explored all you can, the only way to go is up those stairs.

- Bootes 2F

With your first step north you'll reach something you can examine, something
on the floor which says "Take the long road." What does it mean? Well, there's
pitfalls on this floor. Annoying, yeah. It means you should take the longest
paths to get to your destinations.

The direct south path is a pitfall, southwest a dead end, and the southeast
will lead to a terminal and the way forward. Next, take the east path going
north, as the west one is shorter and a pitfall. After the two doors ahead,
you'll find a treasure box with [Dis-Charm x4] in it. The next fork in the
road, take the east to get a box with [Revival Bead x2] and then take the
north path which leads west to stairs up, and go up the stairs.

- Bootes 3F

Another floor, different demons, etc. First order of business is to go around
the west path here. The center one is a pitfall leading to 1F which means you
have to backtrack, and the east one has damage floors. Going through the door
on the other side will have you teleported to 4F during a scene.

In the center of this room is a human, one of the DEMONICA wearing
investigation team members from another ship. Talk to her. It's Zelenin.
The main mission Emergency Signal Inquiry will be completed. The northeast
part of this room has a portal you can unlock to reveal a door. Go through.
You'll be sent back. After that, examine the north wall one tile west of that
door. Now talk to Zelenin again. Another scene, and you'll be teleported to
8F. Now you'll be forced to go through the door in the north as the demon
next to the stairs won't let you pass.

Inside, a scene with Mitra, the demon leader round these parts.
During the scene, you'll be given the [Luxury Bell] and transported back to
your ship. The question responses don't seem to modify alignment.
A new main mission will be added during the scene on the ship.

• Mission: Rescue Zelenin

Re-enter Bootes. After the scene, head back into the palace. Inside the palace
go to 3F once more. You'll now be able to pass the point where you were
teleported away before. East of that door is a box with [Muscle Drink x1].
Grab it and continue on this linear path, reaching a box with [Bead Chain x1]
before you keep on the path, leading to the stairs up to 4F.

- Bootes 4F

There's a terminal in plain view almost immediately after you get onto this
floor. Use it to save. Continue down the path to reach a scene where you
talk to Zelenin from the other side of the door to the room she's in.

A demon will show up and drop you in the room adjacent to where
Zelenin is held. Simply examine the human corpses in all corners of the
room, then go to the center. During the scene, Norris will be experimented
on by the demons and you will have to fight him.

You'll get a choice before the battle...

> What will you do?
> • Go and save him. (Neutral)
> • Keep watching. (Chaos)

If you try to save him, you'll take damage before the fight begins.

---

< Boss: Foul Norris >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 650 / MP: 293 ]

> Nu: Expel, Curse <

Very easy fight. His first name definitely isn't Chuck.
If you have some demons with skills like War Cry it'll make it even easier.
Norris has the Stun Claw ability which can inflict the Paralyze status
ailment which will reduce your character's effectiveness, and he has several
multiple/hit all physical skills.

Just pound away on him and heal when you need to. He may blow himself up at
low HP, causing a small amount of damage to the entire party. Just make sure
your main character's HP never gets too low.

¯¯¯
After the fight, the main mission Search for Norris has been completed.
Head through the south door to Zelenin's cell and then explore Zelenin's
cell to trigger another scene and meet a major character, Mastema.
Search the rest of Zelenin's cell and Mastema will create a pit in the
northwest corner. Use it to drop down to 3F, and then follow the path on
3F to reach a pit to 2F. From 2F, you can move a tile to drop down to
1F where you'll meet Mastema again. Now after the scene, heal up at
the nearby Heal Spot and leave the dungeon back to the Red Sprite.
Mastema will give you the rare Forma [Chiasto Mirror] before you go.

On your way out you'll have to fight a boss, Macabre.

---

< Boss: Spirit Macabre >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 800 / MP: 360 ]

> Nu: Expel, Curse <

He'll pretty much only attack with Physicals, but he can use one
named Blight which can cause the Poison status ailment. If you have
any decent demon that knows Posumudi, you should use it. Otherwise,
if you have demons with buffs/debuffs, make sure to use them as well.

The only major danger in this fight is really having your entire
team poisoned, so having Dis-Poisons and/or Posumudi casters is really
a must here since poison damage can and will do as much damage as you
can heal per turn with Media.

¯¯¯
When you win, get back to the Red Sprite via the terminal or walking or
however you like to get around.

In the ship, you'll get another story scene. The main mission Rescue Zelenin
will now be complete and you'll get a new function for your DEMONICA,
[Enemy Search A] plus a new mission.

• Document: Enemy Search
• Mission: Bootes Rosetta

Enemy Search allows you to find hidden enemies which are enemies you can't
normally meet. They're generally tougher and worth more Macca, and drop nice
or rare items and Forma you can't get elsewhere.

Back in Bootes, head up to 4F. At 4F, save at the terminal and head down the
hall to meet the previously invisible demon that's been messing with you ever
since you arrived in this sector of the Schwarzwelt.

It's a Night Fomorian. Walk up and inspect the Enemy Search reading without
going past it begin the battle with it. It's weak to Wind, and is pretty easy
to kill. Past the door beyond where that battle took place, you'll have two
choices, west or east. West leads to a pitfall, while east leads to a switch on
the wall which activates the elevator, and stairs down to 3F.

It leads to a small area. If you inspect the north wall on the east side,
you can find a hidden portal you can open and go through, leading to a larger
area full of damage floors. In the southwest of this area is a pit leading
down to 2F, where you can find a box with [Sleep Harpe x1] and a way back
to previously explored areas of 2F.

By the way, if you talk to the Hariti demon near the damage floors in the
damage floor room during the Full Moon, she offers an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: That unforgettable taste...

Back on 3F in the room with the damage floors, the north end has some stairs
going up to 4F once again. On this part of 4F, avoid the east path and follow
the west path until you reach a fork, south of which is stairs up. Just head
north to fall down and mark up some more of 4F and then drop down to 3F
damage floor room. Maybe you'll get some forma.

To continue, get to the elevator and ride it up to 4F. Preferably go heal up
on 1F first. In this area of 4F, continue along until you activate an event
with Jimenez. Jimenez will take out a Fallen Bifrons in an automatic battle
you watch, then you'll meet Bugaboo who becomes Jimenez's demon.

> What will you do?
> • Talk to him. (Chaos)
> • Finish him off. (Law)
> • Leave. (Neutral)

You can find stairs up to 5F beyond where this event began.

- Bootes 5F

Explore what you can and then head up the stairs in the southeast.

- Bootes 6F

There's a terminal at the first west. In the northwest, there is a Strike Team
member that will give you [Chakra Drop x3]. Head up the easily visible stairs
afterwards.

- Bootes 7F

On 7F here, there's a Heal Spot to the east of where you enter the floor.
Explore what is readily apparent though there is a pitfall in the
South central area which will cause a bit of backtracking. From the
second door upon entering this floor, go west in a hall until you hit
a wall and you'll find a portal to clear for a door. Go through it
and search the south part to find a switch on a wall to fix another
elevator, this one on the part of 5F you can reach via the elevator.

Afterwards, go north and loop around to find a way down to another part of 6F.

- Bootes 6F

[Dis-Strain x4] in a box can be found in the northwest part of this area,
and a terminal in the west. You can find stairs down to a small part of 5F
which contains [Ma Incense x1] in a box. Back on 6F, you can access the
elevator you just fixed. From that elevator, go up to 7F.

- Bootes 7F

Near the dead end in the north, look for a portal on the west wall to open up
a door. Through that door you can find a terminal and stairs up. The stairs up
lead to where the next boss is, so if you'd like to explore / level up more,
go back to the elevator and take it up to 8F.

A demon, Halphas, on this floor, will offer an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: A sport for gentlemen.

This rewards the UMA's Ball key item.

Low 20s with similar-level demons should be good enough for the next boss.
Don't be weak to Ice, either. Green Vest and Alabaster gun are ideal
equipment for your main character.

Here are my password demons for this upcoming boss.

¯¯¯
Head up to 8F and through the door to meet the next boss when ready.

---

< Boss: Tyrant Mitra >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1200 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Wind / St: Gun / Nu: Ice, Expel, Curse <

He has around 1200 HP and can use Mabufudyne (Ice) and some Phys-type
attacks, as well. Explosive Fist -- a medium single target, and Rampage,
a random target that can hit multiple times.
Yes, he uses Mabufudyne, which is a top-tier ice damage spell.
Nobody better be weak to Ice or they're just going to die.

Aside from this, he has two special attacks.

Waking Dream, which causes some damage to all and a sometimes causes Strain
status that'll cause the target to lose a small amount of MP each round.

Light of Order which is NOT Expel or Curse based, and has a 100% chance of
effect-- it will never, never miss either. It kills a demon.

If you have anything you can use to lower his attack such as War Cry debuff
or Tarunda, go for that. Debuffs are better than buffs here due to the
possible insta-kills on your demons. Just revive any demon who dies with a
Revival Bead and resummon them. He cannot remove buffs or debuffs at all,
so push them to +4/-4 if you're using them.

If you've debuffed his attack, you can easily heal with just Media.

He's not very difficult, but do try to go on the offensive early so you won't
run out of MP on your healers due to Waking Dream's status effect.
You might also try putting a demon that reflects Ice in your party such as
Jack Frost, but Jack Frost may be a little too low-level and weak and may get
destroyed by Mitra's physicals.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Mitra fusion is unlocked.

You'll get the [Stone Fragment] key item for victory, and the item
[Rosetta: Boo]. You will then be automatically returned to the ship.
The main mission will be concluded.

During the scene, you'll travel to the third sector, Carina.

- Carina 1F

[Knockout Gas x3] can be found a bit northeast of the entrance, and
[Muscle Drink x1] in one of the corridors south of there. Far in the northeast
is a Heal Spot and an elevator you can take to 4F. South of those, through a
door, you will meet Mastema again. There's an alignment choice associated
with this meeting.

"Do you recognize me now as different from those demons?"
• I trust you. (Law)
• You do seem different. (Neutral)
• I can't just yet. (Chaos)

Head south from this location and you will find stairs up and then stairs down
right next to them. Go down. You'll be in B1F.

- Carina B1F

A short scene plays where Arthur announces he's found the missing ship.
He'll mark your map, and Jimenez will comment that he's in the area but that
there's "dark areas he can't see in". Dark areas! Joy.

Once you step through that first door, you will be in your very first darkened
area. You must rely on the sounds that you make on impacting with walls to
guide you.

In this dark area, head north as far you can, east as far as you can, 3 tiles
north, then go west and enter the door. Grab the box with [Bead x2] in the
north end of this hall then go back into the dark area. Head east as far as
you can, then north as far you can, then west, then north, then east two tiles.

Consider this a small intersection, north then east will lead to a small room
where you may find a Forma or something. Back at the intersection, go east two
tiles to reach a door. Inside here, you can find a terminal to your east.

From the terminal, go south into the dark area, and west as far as you can then
south as far as you can and through the door. Here, you'll find a Friendly
Jack Frost with an EX Mission. Be a bro and help fulfill a dark hee-ro's
destiny here when you can. It's worth it.

• EX Mission: The snowman's revenge

Beyond the Jack Frost, a box with [Mental Drink x2]. Head back to the terminal
area, and from the dark room's entrance from the terminal, go west one tile
then south as far as you can and enter the door. From here, just take the
south door to reach the map marking.

A scene plays here, and it seems a demon sort of "fused" with the Elve ship.
"Horkos" who looks suspiciously like a series demon, Orcus. You can't do
anything yet, so leave this floor and go visit Mastema on 1F.
A new mission will be added when you accept his request.

• Mission: Mastema's Request

You need to get a Wilder and a Megami demon to Mastema for this next part.

The Strike Team member near Carina's entrance literally both tells you how to
fuse their clans AND gives you passwords for them, they are...

---

Megami Hathor Wilder Jueyuan
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Nymph and Angel Beast and Snake
harem tangle

¯¯¯
Yes, those are ACTUAL passwords. Don't forget the spaces.

They'll summon up the lowest level Megami and Wilder demons.

When you have a Wilder and a Megami demon in your stock, return to Mastema.
Hand the demons over and he'll transform them into the [Shibboleth].
Take the Shibboleth to the Lab on the Red Sprite. You will get the
[Horkos Buster] key item.

Take it into Carina and go to where Jimenez and Horkos are.
Choose to fire it at Horkos, and after the scenes go up to 1F where Mastema
previously was. Horkos is there now. Fire it once again.
You'll get [Chakra Pot x1], [Sacrifice x1], and [Findite]--a rare Forma.
Horkos gets away again though.

Take that Forma to the Lab on the Red Sprite. Your DEMONICA will now have
its unlock ability upgraded to [Unlock B].

With unlock B, you can revisit Antlia and Bootes to do some stuff.
Do it if you want or just skip down to the part where Carina carries on.

- Antlia

After getting the Unlock B upgrade in the Carina sector, you can unlock
the door in the north part of 1F here.

If you did EX Mission "The injured little fairy" earlier, you can find a
High Pixie here who will give an EX Mission line to you, starting with...

• EX Mission: Faerie land establishment I

There are also other colored locked doors but you cannot open them yet.

- Bootes

After getting Unlock B, you can unlock the yellow doors.
[Bead x1] and [1500 Macca] behind a door in northeast 1F, outside the palace.
In southeast 1F, you can meet Dionysus, who will give you an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Death distilled

In the southwest part of 1F where I said it was good to map out earlier, you
can now meet up with Strike Team members for an EX Mission. However, you will
have to fight a Fiend if you do this. He is stronger than the area boss of
Bootes and has instant death curse spells as well as a fear status spell.
He's weak to Elec, but if you go back there like halfway through Carina he
shouldn't be much harder than a regular hidden enemy in the Carina sector.

• EX Mission: Escape plan

To complete this mission, take the following route: Right, Left, Back, Right.

You will then have to fight Fiend David. You get [Death Omen] as a reward.
It'll make a Sub App Fiend Converter for you to fuse Fiends with back at the
Lab when you take it back there.

[Summon Stone x1] is behind a door on 4F's east side.
5F's east side has [Sacrifice x1].
5F's west side has [Bead Chain], and [Ag Incense x1].

- Carina

Back in Carina, you can and should now explore the other floors and behind
some of the yellow taped doors you can now open. [Soma Drop x1],
[Revival Bead x2], [3200 Macca] can be found behind the 1F east door, as
well as a terminal and some stairs up. 4F via the south stairs in 1F
gets you [Amrita Soda x2]. 4F via elevator just has a terminal and a gate
portal that can't be used for now.

Go up the stairs to 2F in east 1F.

- Carina 2F

At first it may seem you can't do anything on this floor either, but west
of the heal spot, on the south wall, look for a portal. You can go through
there once you reveal it. Horkos will be in the small room beyond.

Fire the Buster at him again to get [Bead Chain x1], [Vi Incense x1].
Horkos will flee again, this time to a room just east of there that
you can already access. Fire it once again at Horkos and you'll see
scenes that end with you getting the [Graviton Radio], and taking it
back to the Red Sprite.

More scenes will play, including one in which you're introduced to yet
another important character, Louisa Ferre. I'm sure you know who this is.
A new mission will be added in the scenes after.

• Mission: Carina's Rosetta

The new mission is to go stick that pig. Get into Carina again.
Follow Horkos up the stairs to 2F and near that unworking teleporter.
He'll flee and drop [Swine's Hoof]. Take it back to the ship's Lab.

A new function is added to the DEMONICA, [Phase Shift A].

• Document: Phase Shifter

It should be obvious what this lets you do. It lets you use the space
manipulation device that Horkos fled through. Use it and shift over with
shift A. This also opens up a part of 2F via the south stairs in 1F.
You can get [Lu Incense x1] and [Tetraja Stone x2] there. And if you shift
back over in the area, [Chainsaw x1] plus a direct link to the areas you'd
be exploring anyway.

You can find [Mental Drink x1] and stairs up in this area. East of the stairs
is a secret portal door you can follow to find [Soma x1]. Go up afterwards.

- Carina 3F

When you reach the dark rooms, take the middle door, go south 4 tiles, then
then west, then 2 and open south. Grab the [St Incense x1] from the box.
Go back into the dark. East 2, then south 3, east 1 and open. Explore here,
then back into the dark room the way you came in. Go west 1, south 3 and
open east. Ahead is a terminal and you'll catch a glimpse of the trail of
Horkos. Continue on. At the dead end search to find a portal.

Go through. At the fork, the west path hides a hidden portal leading to a
space manipulator, while south leads to [Chakra Drop x3]. Get the
loot then shift over.

Explore to find [Bead x2], and in east you'll find stairs and a door to a dark
area. In the dark area. Go south 1, east 1, south 1, enter door south.
Go west all the way, then north all the way and open west.
Explore this phase-shift area and you will find stairs up, [Summon Stone x1],
and a terminal.

Up the northeast stairs before the dark area is nothing. Up the newly
discovered stairs past the dark area, Horkos' location will now be marked on
the map. There's a terminal and a clear path to him. Of course, you'll
probably want to heal up first, which you can do by going through the phase
shifted area of 3F and then using the convenient stairways down to 1F.

Ideal equipment for Horkos is a physical resistant armor such as Recycle Vest
and a gun that has either Elec or Fire if you're using Co-Ops, or a gun that
has Arm Shot if you're not going to use a team of same aligned for Co-Ops.
"Blaster" has both Arm Shot and a Fire attack. If you're going to use the
Recycle Vest, make sure you remove it after this boss battle because it is
weak to all four primary magic elements, and that's just not cool.

Here are my password demons for this upcoming boss.

When ready, go into the door to fight Horkos.

He'll ask you a question before battle.

"How will you deal with such excess?"
• We'll learn to control it (Law)
• We need those products. (Neutral)
• Humans can destroy, too. (Chaos)

< Boss: Tyrant Horkos >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1800 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Fire, Elec / St: Phys, Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse <

Horkos heals himself by half the damage he inflicts with one of his weaker
physicals "Taking a Bite". It'd be a good idea to debuff his attack, but to
no more than -3 or he will use Dekunda and just remove it. Same goes for
buffs: No more than +3. Tarukaja, War Cry, Arm Shot, Rakukaja, Rakunda, etc,
are great spells for this fight, but again don't do more than +3 or -3 or
he'll use Dekaja or Dekunda and remove them.

He'll ocassionally summon up a Beast Katakirauwa via skill "Grocery Run" and
eat it a few turns later via "Binge Eating", healing himself for half of the
Katakirauwa's remaining HP. Make sure to target it with anyone who can't do
significant damage to Horkos as to lower the amount of HP he'll gain if/when he
does eat it. Some status ailments will even transfer to him should he eat a
Katakirauwa afflicted by them, including Charm.

The Katakirauwa has 280 HP, for reference, while Horkos himself has 1800.

For an easy time with keeping up with any possible HP gain on Horkos' part,
have multiple fire or elec casters of the same alignment abuse his weakness
for Co-Ops. I personally had 2 Chaos and 1 Neutral demon, plus was neutral
myself and only had 1 fire caster. This again isn't a very difficult battle,
and there's multiple ways to go about winning it.

I've included teams of same-aligned demons that should pretty much destroy
him after the original writing of this, anyway. Use them if needed.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Horkos fusion is unlocked.

You'll get the [Stomach Acid] and [Rosetta: Car] key items, then will
automatically return to the ship.
The main mission Carina's Rosetta is now complete.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

After the scenes, a new main mission is added...

• Mission: Delphinus's Rosetta

Move to the sickbay to begin. Another main mission is added.

• Mission: Inquiry into Commander Gore's Body

Next, to the Lab. Many new Sub Apps are available for you to buy, thanks
to Horkos' Stomach Acid rare Forma. They are:

HP Recover II, MP Recover I, Nurse, Zealot Summons, Friend Item,
Friend Macca, Friend Heal.

On the deck, Dent offers a couple new EX missions.

• EX Mission: Killing time II
• EX Mission: The enchanting spirit

"The enchanting spirit" is the start of a line of EX Missions that is easy
and quite worth the effort in terms of rewards.

Head into Delphinus when you're done with stuff on the ship.

- Delphinus 1F

Time to explore a new sector. [Bead x2] can be found east of the entrance,
[Tetraja Stone x1] in the northeast, [Life Stone x5] in the northwest, and
[Dis-Stone x2] in the southwest.

Stairs to 2F are directly ahead of the entrance.

- Delphinus 2F

Move forward a couple steps and Zelenin will comm you for help. You'll get
a map marking. Ahead of you is a terminal, so save and then head on over.
Or make the motions to. This floor has conveyor-belt like contraptions.
Luckily when you step on them, their directions become marked.

[Poison Gas x1], [Bead Chain x1], [Chakra Drop x2] can be found via taking
the conveyors to places throughout the floor. The first room with a
treasure box accessible from conveyors also happens to have a corpse in
it for the Black box retrieval I EX Mission.

To get to Zelenin, take the east conveyor to begin, then southwest, then
west, the center one going west, and go through the north door and
search for a portal to the east, and go through. Ride the conveyor
then follow the path, ignoring the stairs up and the conveyors along
the way. You'll come to a terminal, and beyond the terminal, Zelenin is
just past a door.

You'll have to fight 2 somewhat stronger Haunt Ghoul and Wilder Nue for
her. But no big deal, really. Head up to the third floor afterwards.

- Delphinus 3F
  Just choose a direction to head in while Zelenin heads in the other here.
  You won't be able to progress further because Jimenez is blocking the way.
  Go into the proper room and Zelenin will comm you again.
  Meet Zelenin over at the stairs down afterwards. She will give you a rare
  Forma [Passage Jewel]. You'll return to the Red Sprite immediately following
  the scenes. A new main mission is added.

• Mission: Treatment Development

Take the Forma you were given by Zelenin to Irving in the Lab.
Your gate search ability is upgraded to [Gate Search B], allowing you to open
up higher level gate portals than before.

The main mission now calls to go back to previously visited sectors. In
this case, to Bootes.

- Bootes

Mastema will show up once you enter, and ask you an alignment altering
question during the scene.

"How to handle such power...?"
• You just have to be careful. (Law)
• I use it only when I have to. (Neutral)
• None of your business. (Chaos)

Melchom here in Bootes has a new EX Mission as well.

• EX Mission: Melchom's task II

There's hidden portals in the northwest and northeast part of 1F.
NE side has [St Incense x1], [Ma Incense x1] and a door leading into the
the palace, but it's a dead end.
NW side has [Ag Incense x1], [Vi Incense x1] and a door leading into the
palace, but also a dead end.

Go in the palace via the normal entrance and take the elevators up to 8F,
then search for a portal in the north hallways. You can find [3000 Macca],
[Bead Chain x3], [Soma Drop x1], and a door leading to an event.
Another scene with Zelenin and Mastema, and you get [Madman's Stone].
Return to the Red Sprite with it, then take it to the Lab.
Take the resulting [MK Gun] to the sickbay.

The main mission Treatment Development is complete.
A new mission is added.

• Mission: Delphinus Parasite Treatment

Dent can offer a new EX Mission if you completed "The enchanting spirit."
In fact, you can ride those missions now until the 6th that Anthony will
offer via Dent.

• EX Mission: To see her again...

Do what you need, then go into Delphinus.

- Delphinus

You need to go around using the MK Gun on the Strike Team members you find
out here. One is in the southwest of 1F, he'll give you [Demonica Code] for
saving him. It's a key item, and in puzzle form. The password can be input as
it is (the "x" are actually multiplication symbols) or you can do the math and
get another password:

2000

It summons a level 39 Vile Mishaguji with Mediarama, Mazionga, Acid Breath.
Better than the one inputting the key item's passcode as-is gives you.
You're probably too low of a level to summon it right now, but maybe later.

After you're done with that business, to the east and west of the stairs to
2F you can find portals that you can now open. Beyond the west,
[Revival Bead x2] and you can talk to a demon, Kudlak.
He'll offer an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Find a sickle called Pest Crop

Behind the east portal, you can find a demon named Kresnik who offers you
another EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Hawthorn Spear needed

When you're done reviewing those, go up to 2F.

- Delphinus 2F

On 2F, you can cure a Strike Team member by taking the first conveyor east
from the entrance. He'll give you [Soma Drop x1]. North of the stairs you
enter from you can also find a portal which opens a shortcut to 3F stairs.

Note that if you do not save these guys before you save Jimenez, they
are later gone and you can't get their free items.

Head up to 3F and proceed to where Jimenez was before. He's still there.
Shoot him with the MK Gun.

You'll return to the Red Sprite for scenes and the Delphinus Parasite
Treatment mission is concluded.

Back in Delphinus, head up to 2F and you'll get a reading in an easily
accessible room. You'll get into a battle with two Spirit Formless.
They have about 500 HP a piece and can cast status ailment spells.
Nothing to worry about. Take them out. After the scenes, go on up to 3F.

- Delphinus 3F

A scene will play here where the main mission Inquiry into Commander Gore's
Body is completed. During the scene....

"Won't you end man's rule on Earth?"
• I will. (Chaos)
• I can't let that happen. (Neutral)

If you answer "I will"...

"Then why don't you cease this invasion of the Schwarzwelt?"
• All right. (Chaos)
• I can't. (Law)

After the scene, go eliminate the map markings-- More Spirit Formless.
Explore the floor afterwards. [5500 Macca] can be had in the southeast part
behind a gate portal, as can [Dis-Para x4]. The stairs up are in the same area
as well. In the west, [Chakra Drop x4]. You can meet a Strike Team member
named McClane here who will give an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: The shadow withdraws

You can find stairs up beyond here. Explore 4F via the stairs you've revealed
thus far, starting with the eastern stairs.

- Delphinus 4F

First thing you'll come across is a demon that tells you about a treasure that
may let you see in the dark, and then a dark room. Go west, then south, then
east, then south to get out of this one.

You'll find a rare Forma, [Kaisetsu Stone] in this room, and a terminal.
If you enter the south door, you'll be in another dark room. Go east 1,
south 2, west 3, south 2, east 1, south 2, west 1 and exit south.
Grab the [Sacrifice x1] from the box here and trip the pitfall in the
southwest corner. Head straight west and grab [Amrita Shower x1] from the
box, then search along the north wall for a door leading into the dark area.
Careful not to step on the conveyor.

In the dark area, go straight west and exit into a room. Grab the
[Kamudo Sword x1] and go back into the dark room. Back in the dark room, go
all the way east, then north, then east and exit north.
You can find stairs up here, but more importantly in the north end of this
area you can unlock a gate portal which is a shortcut to the beginning of 3F.

Go back to the Red Sprite's Lab. Irving will make a new Main App enhancement
for the DEMONICA. Now I don't have to give you long-winded directions for dark
rooms since you'll sort of be able to see in them now with [Visualizer A].

• Document: Visualizer

Now that you can see in dark areas, go up to 3F and take the west stairs up to
4F. As you can see upon entering the dark area, it's not so dark anymore.
The only thing you miss out on is of course that the only thing displayed on
your map is your current location and no actual coverage takes place.

You can find the Strike Team members for McClane's EX Mission in the north
end of this area. After this, head up to 4F via the staircase you can access
via the shortcut opened earlier while acquiring the Kaisetsu Stone.

There's a terminal in plain view if you need it. Heal Spot, too.
The stone statue to the north looks interesting, doesn't it? It should if
you know your SMT, as you already know who it is. However, for now you can do
nothing with it. Go through the dark areas to either side of it, and go up to
5F via the stairs.

- Delphinus 5F

More dark areas almost immediately. Great thing for that App, huh?
This floor has not only dark areas but conveyors in the dark.
Enter from the far east, and while in the first corridor heading
west, take the third conveyor to your left. Avoid the conveyors and look
for the door. Continue to the terminal, and west past the terminal into
the dark area.

After the conveyor ride, head west then north onto the next conveyor.
Then take the next path north onto a conveyor. Then go east and south onto
the conveyor. When it stops, go east then ride the conveyor north. Enter the
door visible to east. You can now find the way up to 6F.

- Delphinus 6F

Use the terminal. Now you have to ride some more conveyors and deal with
switches to reverse their directions. Thankfully, the new direction is
displayed on revealed conveyors.

Ride the westmost one and flip the switch, then ride it back down.
Now ride the one first one just to east of the one you got off of, and
navigate to the stairs without stepping on any conveyors, avoiding
a south turn.

If you mess this up, the conveyors don't reset when you come back to the
floor so you'll need to get to the eastmost conveyor switch and then
work your way back to the beginning of this floor.

Go up the stairs when you reach them.

- Delphinus 7F

More conveyor hijinks. To begin, go north, west, then ride the south
conveyor. Then the west. Flip the switch and ride the two conveyors
you rode here back to the entrance to the floor. Now ride the one east of it,
go 1 south, two east, 2 south, and ride east then south.

Flip the switch, then ride the first one you just rode back, then take the
north one. You can now enter a room with one of the readings.
More Spirit Formless to fight. Take them out.

Now repeat the process of hitting both conveyor switches, and when you hit
the second switch this time, move in the following order...

From the switch, northeast conveyor, west conveyor. Now ride the ones to your
southwest, the west of which works when the switch is pressed this way.
Ride the westmost one, then when it stops turn west and ride that one.
Enter the door to fight two more Spirit Formless. You'll have to fall
down the pit to 6F after their defeat.

Make your way back up to 7F. On 7F, hit the first switch, then from there
ride only the very first conveyor back, then go south and you'll be able
to find the stairs from there if you avoid further conveyor contact.

- Delphinus 8F

Avoid opening any doors here until you find the Terminal. Save up. Now, any
of the doors here on this floor (including the hidden portals right near the
stairs you came in) may have Spirit Formless in them, if the Formless spirit
didn't already announce it'd show you its true form. If it has already
announced this, go down to 4F.

- Delphinus 4F

Big surprise. The room the statue was in is now marked for a Rosetta
reading. Save and heal here. Enter the room when ready.

Make sure you don't have armor that is weak to fire equipped.
Preferably, equip one that is strong to fire. Boss uses Maragidyne.

Equipping the Rock Vest made from Delphinus materials is a good idea,
and if you're using same alignment demons then a gun which has some
Ice spells such as the Frost Cannon from the Jack Frost EX Mission
in Carina.

As usual, here's a roster of demons that will get you through, should you
have problems with the boss with your own demons.

You'll get an alignment choice from Asura, the boss, before you fight him.

"And with it, your spirit...?"
• That's all a lie. (Law)
• It's the demons' fault. (Neutral)
• We're recovering already. (Chaos)

< Boss: Tyrant Asura >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 2000 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Ice / St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Fire, Wind <

Asura reflects Fire and Wind attacks, so those are out. He is weak to Ice.

For the first round, make sure to guard with everyone. Otherwise, you have
a high chance of being afflicted by the Rage status from the Asura Roga
attack he will always launch on the first round. An ally under rage status
will attack random targets including allies and does much more damage.
This is mostly bad because you can end up killing allies.

He'll regularly use Maragidyne afterwards, which is why you need the
protection against fire. He can also use a random hit fire spell which isn't
nearly as powerful, Concentrate, and Ashura, a powerful random physical attack
that can hit multiple times. At low HP, he might also use "Black Flame", a
fire spell which hits random targets and has high power like Maragidyne.

I cast Bufudyne with my Black Frost, debuffed his attack to -3 (War Cry and
Arm Shot) and healed with a demon that knows Mediarama as needed.

This isn't an easy fight due to the Rage status. He'll reuse Asura Roga every
5-6 turns, so be ready to defend. How many and who get afflicted by the
effect can make or break this fight.

I've also heard some people have had some luck just going it solo with the MC
attacking with a sword under the rage status and healing themself with stocked
up Beads when they weren't raged, but this is very risky and probably not
going to work so well unless you're pretty overleveled since the Ashura phys
attack may kill you.

Of course, after the original writing of this walkthrough I have included
teams of demons that will absolutely destroy him. It'll cost, though.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Asura fusion is unlocked.

You'll get key items [Ulna] and [Rosetta: Del].
You will automatically go back to the Red Sprite and more story scenes will
play out. Zelenin presents a question that can alter alignment:

"Can you go back with no regrets?"
• I just want out of here. (Chaos)
• There's something on my mind. (Law)
• First let's find a way out. (Neutral)

After the scenes, a new sector opens up.

- Eridanus 1F

Place looks kind of like Eden from SMT 2. A demon here, Thoth, can give an
EX Mission, the start of a mission line.

• EX Mission: The wise man's library I

[Chakra Drop x3], [Dis-Stone x4], [Bead x1] can be found on this floor as
treasures. You'll want to make your way around to the eastern stairs to 2F,
which is next to a terminal.

- Eridanus 2F

A Dark area!... and the function you got last area doesn't seem to work here.
What a pain. Luckily, this dark area is very easy to navigate.
If you go straight north until you can't, then straight west, you will find
your way to a door which leads to where you need to go.

There's no treasures or anything here. You'll want to go down the stairs.
Explore more of this dark area floor if you want, but there's no need to
unless you want the exploration achievement for this floor.

- Eridanus 1F

Another area of 1F. Zelenin will give you a call. However if you go east
you can find a rare Forma [Goetite] by an easily accessible secret portal.
After you get it, go to Zelenin straight north of where you came onto
this floor. A sort of strange device.

Anyway, take the Goetite back to the Lab on the Red Sprite right now.
Your DEMONICA's search function is upgraded to [Forma Search B].
It may also be a good idea to get the "Nurse" Sub App for upcoming trap
floors that cause status ailments.

You can now find more forma out on the field. Anyway, head back into the
dungeon and make your way back to where Zelenin was. Make sure you equip
the Nurse or Medic sub app if you've got it because of the upcoming ailment
floor tiles, sleep being especially nasty. Luckily, running away from a
battle will wake everyone up.

Green floors cause sleep, and purple cause poison.

[Amrita Soda x2], [Me Patra Stone x3] can be found along this pathway.
You'll run into Bugaboo halfway across this annoying trap tile field,
and if you check north of where you met him you can find a sleeping Jimenez.
If you wake Jimenez up, he'll give you [Patra Stone x5]. Continue on past
until you reach a terminal. Save and go up the stairs beyond it.

- Eridanus 2F

No treasures. A lot of obvious gate-type portals in between pillars here.
The one you're looking for is in the southwest part of this area.
It'll lead to a space manipulation device. Phase Shift over.

You can grab [Balm of Rising x1] almost immediately. Look for a secret
door on the east wall near the entry point and you'll find a rare Forma
inside, [Asteria Stone]. Zelenin requests you bring it to her.

You'll be able to find some stairs down to the north, so take them down.

- Eridanus 1F

This is a small area that connects to where you need to go. If you wake
up the sleeping Strike Team member, he'll give you [Dis-Poison x5].
You can find [Soma x1] here in a box, and a portal in the southwest
to continue south to where you need to get. Past there, [Agilao Stone x3],
stairs up, and of course a portal making a shortcut to the area which
Zelenin is in.

Go see Zelenin. This activates a teleport to a new area. Go back for now.
South of the teleport device's original location, take the stairs up.

Ame no Uzume is here and gives an EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Marebito, the foreign god

You can also find a shortcut back to where you can heal and save.
The stairs north of where you met Zelenin, past the opened shortcut
will also lead to another shortcut to this heal/save area, though
nothing more can be done there for now.

This makes it easy to travel from the sector entrance to this
heal area and further beyond to traveled areas.

Back past the teleport device Zelenin activated, you'll run into another
teleport device guarded by a Ghoul, though you can't get through without
"permission" he says. Go up the stairs beyond.

- Eridanus 2F

Another shortcut to the heal/save area opens, and south of there you
can begin to explore by going up to 3F.

- Eridanus 3F

There's a Heal Spot up here immediately, which is odd placement given how
there's one not very far away.

In the west and east are two portals leading to rooms with demons in them
who will challenge you to specific battles with rules. In the east is
Kazfiel and the west is Zouchouten.

From Zouchouten...

• EX Mission: The ever-steeper trial I

From Kazfiel...

• EX Mission: Before the holy battle I

Defeating them unlocks them for fusion and gets you items for Sub Apps.
Also, you may have noticed secret doors in these rooms you can't open.
Come back later with higher rank Unlock and Gate Search Main Apps and you'll
be able to challenge the next heavenly king or angel.

In the south is an elevator. You can ride it to the "TOP" floor.

- Eridanus TOP

To the west here is a hidden gate portal that leads to a terminal and heal
spot. A powerful demon is detected to the north. However as you approach it
a scene will play where you and all members of the Red Sprite team are ordered
back to the ship. You can't progress anyway. No way to get through the portal
with your current Gate Search main app.

Go back to the ship for now.

You'll be assigned to a new mission in Carina.

• Mission: Signal Investigation

- Carina

Inside Carina, take the elevator in northeast 1F up to 4F.
Look for a hidden door near the terminal, on the west wall.

Look inside for more portals on the west wall and you'll trigger a scene
behind one of the doors. A new main mission will be added during it.

• Mission: Jack's Bargain

During the scene, you'll get an alignment question...

"Can we establish cordial relations?"
• Humans should help each other. (Neutral)
• I'd sooner trust the demons. (Chaos)
• I don't trust anyone easily. (Law)

You can explore what's left to find [Muscle Drink x3] and [Vi Incense x1].
You can also pickup a new EX Mission from a goblin.

• EX Mission: A formal search request

The new mission calls to return to Eridanus and pickup Forma for Captain Jack.

- Eridanus

Back where the ghoul was guarding the teleporter earlier on the way to 3F, you
can now use that teleporter since Captain Jack's demon will let you by.

In the room the teleport drops you in, you can open up a shortcut in the
south with Gate Search, and if you look around in the southwest part of the
room will be able to find a Strike Team member corpse for the EX Mission
"Black box retrieval II". The west door in this room leads on...

Beyond here, I hope you like teleporter mazes, because that's where we're
going to be for now. In this first room, either the north or west teleport
will lead to the same spot while the south leads to the entrance of this
room. Take the north or west, obviously.

Grab the [Chakra Pot x1] here and then take the south teleport tile.
Take the east teleport next, then west. Grab the [Caladbolg x1], then take the
south teleport. You can find the [Hydro Apple] needed for the main objective
here. Now take the north teleport and in this area, don't go far south but
instead trigger a teleport midway down.

Head west 1 tile, south 1 tile, west 1 tile, south 1 tile. At this destination
a forma will be visible, [Ice-10]. Another one Jack wanted. You can access the
heal/save area via a shortcut up the stairway northeast of here.

South of those stairs up is a portal you can go through. Explore this new
area, but avoid going through a door in the very northwest or you'll have to
go through the teleport maze again or through the opened up shortcut near the
termina/healspot area hub to get back. Lots of pitfalls on 2F, but as long as
you avoid that northwest corner 1F door you won't get stuck messing around in
that teleport maze again.

You can find [Sacrifice x1] on the first floor, [Garula Stone x3],
[Bufula Stone x3], [10000 Macca], [Zionga Stone x3].
The way to proceed is through a gate portal in the east end of 1F, which
leads up to stairs to 2F. From this part of 2F, you'll want to head straight
west and drop down from a pit to a part of 1F you can only access from here.

You can go back up to 2F from here, grab [Lu Incense x1] and continue on to
drop back to 1F in another new part. From there you can unlock a shortcut
back to the area you've already been in. You can unlock several shortcuts to
areas already explored, and get the [X-Metal] for Captain Jack as well.

One of the shortcuts is conveniently placed near the entrance to this sector.
Use it to get out, and take the forma back to Carina, to Captain Jack.
The mission Jack's Bargain will now be complete.
Return to the Red Sprite.

Now in Eridanus, go up to the top and head towards the ! mark on the map.

- Eridanus TOP

A Jack's squad member will give you an upgrade to your Gate Search function.
[Gate Search C]. Now you can open higher level portals, which means you can
go behind the door to that marked !. However, the boss behind there is very
strong and you probably won't be able to kill it just yet.

Explore the rest of the floor. Obviously placed gate-type portals are there,
starting from the southeast corner of the map. The floor is symmetrical.
[Bead Chain x1] is along the way east heading north, and you'll eventually
run into a suspicious area that you've already mapped before if you did the
EX Mission with the three Dis back in Bootes. The conclusion to that
EX Mission takes place here. You can find out who saved you.
If you accept, you'll get a new EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Fateful Aid

Further along the path that loops around this floor you can find a demon,
Dantalian, that will give another EX Mission.

• EX Mission: Tales of investigation

You'll probably need to level up and fuse demons appropriate for the next
boss because it has an annoying habit of regenerating ~160 hp every turn,
and that's quite a lot. Level 45 for your main character or better is ideal.

The idea is to exploit its weakness, fire, and to get Co-Op attacks in.
You need demons resistant or better to Expel or it'll go poorly.
Make sure your MC also doesn't have a weakness to Expel with his current
armor or you'll probably die. Thiotimo Vest is a good choice of armor.
Randall is a good choice of Gun.

Here are three sets of demons, one for each alignment. Once again, these
are probably not going to be cheap, but if you are having trouble with
Ouroboros like a lot of people do then you will find that using any
set of demons aligned the same as your MC will make things easy.

¯¯¯
Go inside the boss' chamber when ready.

She'll ask you a question that affects alignment, of course.

"Can you overcome our endless power?"
• Our power is also endless. (Neutral)
• Your enemy's power is endless. (Law)
• I want that power. (Chaos)

< Boss: Snake Ouroboros >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 2300 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Fire / St: Phys, Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Dr: Elec <

Ouroboros is hard. Very hard. If you're using the demons I list above,
begin the battle by buffing to +3 with Luster Candy and throw up Tetraja
while dropping Ouroboros down to -3 with Debilitate and then spam some
Agidyne with the demons. It should be relatively easy with that setup,
if all goes right. If she casts Mahama, reuse Tetraja.

Spells that drop her defense and raise your offense are pretty much key
if you're not using really good demons, as the HP regen that takes place
every round is about 160 hp and without the damage output you'll probably
either never kill her due to low damage output, or you will run out of
juice before you can kill her.

Don't go to +4 or -4 with any buff or debuff abilities as Ouroboros knows
Silent Prayer which cancels all parameter changes on both sides, and will
use it if you go to +4 on yourself or if you -4 her.

Ouroboros has a few attacks. Mahama, which is Expel-based instant death
though a relatively low chance on those resistant to expel.
Wild Thunder, which is a hit-all Elec spell. A regular phys attack that hits
twice, and a spell that causes random status ailments, Disaster Cycle.

Hopefully, she'll use the phys attacks and Mahama and not hit any of your
demons with Mahama. The elec spell is kind of powerful, and the random status
ailments can be nasty as well if you get things like Bomb or Stone.
It can be pretty much any status ailment though, so the chance of getting
your Main Character petrified by Disaster Cycle is pretty low.

If all goes well, you should kill her in 6-7 turns with my setup.
Maybe even less.

With a bad setup, you'll probably not even do enough damage to offset the
natural regeneration that occurs every round. Sucks, yeah.

¯¯¯
After the battle, you'll be forced out of the boss room during a scene.

Now you'll need to go destroy the 4 energy sources explained during the
scene. They're clearly marked on your map in areas you'd have already visited
here on the top floor. They're simply encounters with regular enemies that
have a bit more HP. No big deal. Crush them.

Now you'll have to go fight Ouroboros again.

---

< Boss: Snake Ouroboros >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 3200 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Fire / St: Phys, Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Dr: Elec <

The regeneration is gone, but now there are more attacks and she has higher
HP. One of the new attacks is Wave of Death, a hit-all phys skill, so you may
wish to equip a Strong to phys armor (that still retains Expel resistance)
to your Main character instead of the Thiotimo vest suggested for the last
battle with Ouroboros.

Again, use the same buffing strategy and then use Fire skills to Co-Op.

This fight is not really any harder than the previous one. Perhaps even
easier if your damage output is lowish since it won't drag on as long.

¯¯¯
• Snake Ouroboros fusion is unlocked.

You'll get the [Klein Bottle] and [Formless Mass] key items.
The main mission Find the Vanishing Point is complete.
You'll automatically return to the Red Sprite for some scenes, one of
which has a questiom from Jimenez.

"What do you think, [main character first name]?"
• We owe it to mankind.
• Fine, long as it's destroyed.
• I just want to forget it all.

Doesn't seem to affect alignment, though.

Didn't think it'd be that easy, did you?
After the scenes, it's time to continue the journey.

- Fornax 1F

Time to begin exploration! First, take the east door and map those areas
out. You'll find [Balm of Rising x1] and [Amrita Soda x2].

In the west hall, you can find a Demon, Futotama, who if you'd taken the EX
Mission from Ame no Uzume in Eridanus, will give you [Tamashiro Mirror].
Further on you'll find [Soma Drop x1] and then a terminal. Save.
South of there, a warning about a powerful demon and a shortcut secret door.

Make sure you don't have a fire weakness before you proceed.

If you go east from there, someone you've already met will show himself
once again. It's Morax! Or really, Moloch, as he displays his true self
to be.

An alignment choice takes place before you fight.

"Learn the greatness of demons!"
• I already know. (Chaos)
• Stay away from humans. (Neutral)
• Demons should die. (Law)

< Boss: Tyrant Moloch >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 2200 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Ice / St: Gun, Elec / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Fire <

The fight is almost the same as the Morax fight. He just deals more
damage with stronger attacks this time. The party I had thrown together
for Ouroboros still worked just fine. Use Ice attacks if you've got them
for Co-Ops if you're using same aligned, etc.

He has Maragidyne instead of Maragi. That's the only skill change.
Just make sure the main character is not weak to Fire and you'll win.

Basically I just buffed to +4 with Luster Candy, debuffed his attack
and attacked a few rounds. Had I known how little HP he has and how weak
he is, I probably would have turned on Auto battle.

If he uses Gehenna, you may wish to use a Me Patra Stone to remove the fear
effect from your party members. No better time to use them, really.

¯¯¯
• Tyrant Moloch fusion is unlocked.

Continue on past where Morax/Moloch busted down the wall and you'll run
into an event with Louisa Ferre.

A new main mission is added.

• Mission: Defeat the Three Demons

So it seems you must re-fight the demons who carried Rosettas before,
only in their true, stronger forms. Mitra, Horkus and Asura await.

Begin with the west door. This will lead to Mitra.

- Fornax B1F

This is an easy to navigate floor with a few one-way doors.
You can find Alice here who will give you an EX Mission.
Doing so will unlock Fiend Alice for fusion and give [Hexagram], though you
will have to defeat her and deal with the "Die for Me!" signature attack in
doing so. Hexagram becomes Main App [Forma Search C].

• EX Mission: Catch the rabbit!

You can find [Dekunda Stone x2] in a box here on this floor as well.
Make your way down to B2F.

- Fornax B2F

The theme of this floor and the ones below it is pitfalls.
In order to get to Mitra, fall down west of the terminal here on this floor.

- Fornax B3F

On B3F, search for a hidden door in the middle and fall down the pit on
the east side.

- Fornax B4F

On B4F, you can collect [Bead Chain x1] and fall down to B5F next to a
terminal.

- Fornax B5F

Save. Prepare for battle with Mitra. Equip similar resists that you'd need to
fight him. You'll notice a broken wall nearby. East of it, you can find a
rare Forma [Sun Mirror]. When you head back west, you will meet Mitra, who
also busts in like the Kool-Aid man like Moloch did earlier. Mitra, or should
I say, Mithras, shows his true form.

"We should rule over humans!"
• Why can't we coexist? (Neutral)
• That way is wrong. (Law)
• You may be right... (Chaos)

< Boss: Fallen Mithras >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 2300 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Wind / St: Gun, Fire / Nu: Expel, Curse, Ice <

He's actually easier than Mitra was, comparatively. He now uses Ice Breath
instead of Mabufudyne, which does less damage than Mabufudyne, but the fight
is otherwise the same. Still has Light of Order and Waking Dream.

He has more HP and hits harder, but not so much that it's an issue.

Co-Op with Wind if you can or just abuse parameter buffing and slaughter
him with your attack command. I don't know what to say. Have fun with this
one because harder bosses are coming soon.

¯¯¯
• Fallen Mithras fusion is unlocked.

You'll be forced to return to the Red Sprite for an emergency mission to check
up on what Jack's squad is doing.

Head into Jack's base for a scene with Ryan of Jack's squad. Back on the
Red Sprite, Jimenez will decide to stay behind and spy on them, even if you
volunteer to do it.

You can go back to Fornax now and continue with the three demons mission.

If you didn't explore the west stairs from 1F fully, you can do so to collect
[Bead x2], [Attack Mirror x2], [St Incense x1], and [Soma x2].

- Fornax 1F

Take the east stairs on 1F next to get to Horkos.

- Fornax B1F

This is a very straight-forward floor. Has one treasure chest with
[Chakra Pot x1] and some stairs down.

- Fornax B2F

When you come to your first door, you'll unfortunately have to enter a dark
area which you again cannot see in. Shame. However, this one is easy to
navigate. Just go west and at the end of the path, search south for a door.

Find the next door on this linear path to enter another dark area.
From this one, go all the way east, then south 2 steps and face west to enter
a door. Grab the [Magic Mirror x2] in here, then go back into the dark area
and trace your way back to the very entrance of the dark area.
From it, go south all the way and search for a door east. Follow the path
to the stairs and go down them.

- Fornax B3F

A Heal Spot is readily accessible, and beyond it, a dark room.
There are a lot of "places" you can go on this floor, but basically the only
place of worth is to make your way northwest of the entry point to get to a
pretty easy-to-find door on the west wall, and go through.
Through there, you'll find a door to another dark area which is literally
3 tiles with a door in the southeast. Take the stairs down.

- Fornax B4F

Use the terminal straight ahead. Head into the south door, into a dark room.

Go two tiles west, then all the way south, then east and enter.
Go down the stairs and grab [Ma Incense x1] then go back up and into the dark
room you just came from.

Back in the dark room, head west 1 tile, all the way north, all the way west,
then north, then west, then south. Enter the door, then go down the stairs.

- Fornax B5F

Use the Heal Spot and terminal to save. Prepare to fight Horkos again.
Same resists and general demon setup Now head through the 1-way door.
Immediately, your Forma search should pickup a forma. Go grab it, it's rare
forma [Moon Mirror]. Head along the only path available to you and you'll meet
a familiar porcine face. Actually, the group used for Ouroboros still works
here as well due to their Fire spells.

He also busts through a wall as if he were in a Kool-Aid commercial, showing
his true form, Orcus.

"Tremble in the face of death!"

> Wk: Fire, Elec / St: Phys, Gun, Ice / Nu: Expel, Curse <

Weird design. Nothing like the classic Orcus design which was what Horkos
was using.

Similar to Moloch and Mithras, he isn't much harder than when you fought his
other form. The fight is much the same. He has more HP and hits harder, and
he summons a more powerful Katakirauwa. That's... about it. He only has 2400
HPs whereas Horkos had 1800. That's a mere 600 HP difference and you're much
more powerful now than you were in Carina.

¯¯¯
• Reaper Orcus fusion is unlocked.

After the battle, you are once again recalled because Jimenez is a piss-poor
excuse of a spy. Make your way out of this dump by going up the stairs
available to you in the northeast -- not west, then whe on 4F go through
into the dark area.

Go 2 tiles west, 1 south, and you'll be on 4F next to the terminal. Use it to
get out of there.

Back on the Red Sprite, scenes. A new mission is added.

• Mission: Save Crewman Jimenez

Head to the Lab and Irving tell you the Sun Mirror and Moon Mirror can be
turned into a new Main App with a little something else added to them.
Save up, heal up and head into Jack's Squad HQ.

* Jack's Squad HQ 1F

Head forward and you'll have to fight two Human Soldiers.
When you win, go through the door.

You can immediately access a terminal and Heal Spot. Go west into the room
and talk to the soldiers in the middle to begin a fight with
two Human Soldiers and Human Sergeant.

Now exit this room and take the east path, and enter the southeast door.
Another fight, the same as in the last room.
Flip the switch to off after the battle.

Explore the rest of 1F. The door leading to the Lightning is open but the
hatch to the ship is shut. There's obvious secret doors in the northwest
and in the northeast room. Behind the NW one is [Life Stone x5] and a nother
secret door behind which you may find a random Forma.
Behind the northeast one is rare Forma [Piercing Stone]. Take it back to the
Red Sprite's Lab.

Irving will upgrade your Visualizer function to [Visualizer B].
Back in Jack's Squad HQ, head down the stairs in southern 1F.

- Jack's Squad HQ B1

Try to check the door, but it'll say it's locked. Search the room for a portal
and go through it. Continue and enter the door beyond. A fork, north or south.
Take the south path and grab the [Frag Grenade x2] from the south room and
then take the north. You will meet Louisa Ferre once more.

Past where you met our obvious friend, go into the dark area. Your new
Visualizer upgrade can now let you see in the red dark areas. Nice.
Go into the first room you see to get [Bead x2] then go back into the dark.

Continue along that linear path and enter the first room you come across.
In this room, ask the scientist about Jimenez's whereabouts.
Ask about him being a scientist afterwards, and he'll give you the code.
Back in the dark room, take the southmost door here and grab the box with
[Nerve Gas x2]. Now go back to the beginning of the floor.

You can now enter the locked door. Do what you want during this scene, the
results are no different. Wow... what a scene. Very reminiscent of what the
Chaos Hero did to himself in SMT 1 if you've played it. Choosing to willingly
fuse Jimenez with Bugaboo during this scene gives a small shift toward Chaos
alignment, but as I said before it happens no matter what.

You now need to head to the Lightning, which is on 1F's north end.

Get ready for a hard boss fight. The trick to this one is to try to charm him
while dumping as much damage as possible on him, preferably while you have
a team with demons that reflect Gun. Randy Shot from the Desonberi gun is a
good choice. Charm Strike or Marin Karin demon skills are decent damage
dealers that may charm, too. Make sure no one is weak to Gun as that's
Captain Jack's main form of damage output.

If you need demons, here they are. There's just a set of three of them for
this battle as Jack has no weakness to exploit for Co-Ops. They're varied
alignment, but more importantly they all repel Gun attacks.

- Jack's Squad HQ 1F

Jimenez is determined to get revenge on Captain Jack, so head up there to
Jack's Squad's ship, the Lightning. After the scene, you will fight Jack.

---

< Boss: Human Jack >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 2016 / MP: 9999 ]

> Nu: Expel, Curse <

He has no weakness. So it doesn't matter what demon alignments you use.

Jack comes with two Spirit Pisaca demons. You will want to eliminate them ASAP
to stop them from potentially causing Bomb status to any of your party
members. If it happens, use Bomdi or Amrita spells or a Dis-Bomb or Amrita
Soda or Shower item to remove bomb as needed. It's a rather nasty effect, as
you probably know by now if you've had an enemy use it on you.
The Pisacas are weak to Fire.

Captain Jack himself can use a weak normal phys attack and nasty heavy damage
random gun attack called Rain Strike. He can also heal himself for 400-1000 HP
with "Pure Blue" which also removes all debuffs from him. He can also use
Sunset Melody, which does some almighty damage to the party and reduces attack
by -1. Dekunda or Dekunda Stones are nice here if you aren't using Tarukaja or
Luster Candy, which you really should be anyway.

Pure Blue is why charm is recommended. If you don't charm him, the only other
viable strategy is to use gun reflecting demons and _hope_ his random attacks
hit them to reflect the gun shots back to him, or perhaps spam Attack Mirrors
and hope for him to use Rain Strike although he may choose to just use
Pure Blue the next round anyway, wasting a good precious item.

To begin the battle, take out the Pisacas. They're weak to fire if you want to
go the co-op route. If you used the Alraune demon I've listed above or have
fused your own demon with Luster Candy, begin to buff up to +4 as Jack cannot
remove your buffs and you'll need the extra damage the attack buff gives.

With your Main character and any demons that can charm, keep trying to stick a
Charm to him. When you get it, go all out. Hopefully you'll kill him before
he uses Pure Blue again. If the charm wears out, perhaps try to go all out and
kill him before he uses Pure Blue before you try to charm again.

It is possible you could take him from full to dead without charming him, but
the chances are quite small. So use Charm. It doesn't have a high chance to
work, but when it does you've likely won the battle. High powered physicals
such as Mortal Jihad should be unloaded on him once you get him charmed.

My own custom demon team built for this battle works off of a combination of
reflecting gun attacks and damage+charm attacks. If you use it, you should
not have much of a problem winning the fight long as Jack doesn't just kind
of decide to Pure Blue over and over and...

¯¯¯
No matter what you choose after the battle, Jimenez will do the same thing to
ol' Jack... but your choice can affect alignment.

> Jimenez raised his hand...!
> • Stop Jimenez (Law)
> • Watch (Neutral)

Mission Save Crewman Jimenez is now completed. You'll automatically be taken
back to the Red Sprite. Arthur will give you rare Forma [Star Mirror] which
was confiscated from Jack's Squad.

An alignment choice takes place during the scene on the Red Sprite.

"Should Jimenez be relieved?"
• He's not a problem. (Chaos)
• We should wait and see. (Neutral)
• Probably so. (Law)

Take the rare Forma the Lab after the scenes.
Irving will transform the Sun Mirror, Moon Mirror, and Star Mirror into an
upgraded [Enemy Search B] function. This will be needed soon, and aside can
be used to find the hidden Fiend clan demons at a higher rate.

Afterwards, it is time to head back into Fornax.

- Fornax

Back here in Fornax, you can do two things. Fully explore the east side
where Orcus was now that you can see in the red dark areas, or head on
with the main mission in the central door on 1F.
There's no items or anything left down on the east side-- I had you grab
them before. But if you want to explore, then explore.
Head down to B1F of Fornax via the middle stairway on 1F to continue
with the main mission!

- Fornax B1F

Simply head straight through the doors and go down.

- Fornax B2F

Grab the [Soma Drop x1] and go down the stairs.

- Fornax B3F

Grab the [Amrita Soda x1] and continue down.

- Fornax B4F

Head on down.

- Fornax B5F

Save and heal here. Then go into the main room.
The Demonica will react. Choose to Perform a scan.

You will have to fight Spirit Strange Demon, who can use Maragion and
Asura Roga, the same annoying skill that causes Rage that Asura used.
It's not very difficult, so take it out.

Afterwards, prepare a party that's similar in resistances to when you fought
Asura back in Delphinus. Emphasis on physical resistance this time though,
since the boss only uses Maragion for fire spells but the physical damage
output is much scarier this time around. "Armor Vest" armor plus a good
gun with Ice spells such as Frost Cannon will suffice.

Head down the stairs to 6F whe you're ready.

- Fornax B6F

You'll meet Asura again, or rather Asherah. No Kool-Aid man antics this time
though. And of course, alignment stuff. The demons used for Ouroboros should
still be sufficient here at this point if you're still using them, so I still
don't need to hand you out new passwords... yet.

"Destruction will rejuvenate Earth!"
• I won't let you. (Neutral)
• You're distorting things. (Law)
• Maybe you're right... (Chaos)

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 2500 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Ice / St: Elec, Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Fire, Wind <

Unlike Moloch, Orcus and Mithras, Asherah is no pushover.

Much like Asura, she'll open up with Asura Roga on the first round. Guard.
Next round buff up with Luster Candy if you've got it, or Rakukaja otherwise
and debuff her with Arm Shot/War Cry/Tarunda/Debilitate, whatever you've got.
No more than +3/-3 or she'll remove them with Dekaja/Dekunda.

Every 5-6 turns generally, Asura Roga is reused.

She uses Maragion and rarely the same Black Flame random heavy damage fire
spell that can hit 0-2 times on everyone that Asura had. This isn't as deadly
as Asura using Maragidyne constantly was, though, which is why Phys resistance
is better for this fight than fire resistance. Asherah tends to use the Ashura
attack more often and is pretty painful with it.

If she uses Charge, make sure to guard next turn with those who are not
resistant to Physical because a Charge + Ashura combo will kill them for
sure.

She only has a few hundred HP more than Asura did, but the hard part is
finding turns where you're not raged or need to heal in order to whittle it
away. Co-Ops using Ice spells are recommended where possible.

Things can go bad though, like Ashura randomly killing your healers with a
multi-hit Ashura on them, but as long as your Main Character is strong to
Phys, you don't have -too- much to worry about here...

Slug it out and hope for the best with how she chooses her attacks.

¯¯¯
• Lady Asherah fusion is unlocked.

The Main Mission Defeat the Three Demons is also concluded.
Now you have to go kill the one who revived them.

Map out the whole accessible floor. You'll have to go through dark areas
but it won't be a problem since you can see in them.
There's no secret doors accessible from where you're at. So when you've mapped
it all out, use the space manipulation device in the south and shift on over.

Now explore the shifted area. You can grab [Megido Stone x2], open up a
secret door in the northeast of the phase shifted area which you can later
find a treasure [Great Chakra x1] in the northeast part of the normal,
non-phase shifted floor by passing through the now-opened doorway.

Explore the southwest end and open up the portal down there for a shortcut
back to the south end of the floor if you choose to shift back and get
that treasure.

It's easy to find your way to the stairs down to 7F, so go ahead and make
your way down there after you've gotten any treasures you want.

- Fornax B7F

You can save and heal right away in the first room. North is the boss' mark
on your map. Make sure you're not weak to Ice. Hardwired is a good armor
to be using, and any gun with an Elec attack if you're using same aligned
demons for Co-Op.

Here's a set of password demons.

< Boss: Drake Tiamat >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 4500 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Elec / St: Gun / Nu: Fire, Expel, Curse / Dr: Ice <

Very easy boss if you're prepared with buffs and Dekaja or Debilitate.

Tiamat uses Mabufudyne, Glacial Blast, and Mother Earth, all ice spells.
Mother Earth heals her for about half the damage done to you, but if you
buff up this won't be much and in fact will maybe be like half of what your
main character can do with a sword strike. No kidding.

In addition, she uses Luster Candy and Sunset Melody. You know what Luster
Candy does, and if you saw Jack use it, you know what Sunset Melody does.
Sunset Melody does almighty damage to the group and lowers your attack
parameter by -1. Again, no problem if you have Luster Candy or Tarukaja on
one of your own characters to offset the loss of attack power.

You just remove her Luster Candy with Dekaja or offset it back to 0 with
Debilitate, buff yourself to +4 with Luster Candy or other and slug away
with powerful physicals or Elec spells. She can't Dekaja your +4'd parameters.

Just don't use debuffs on her or she'll use Pure Blue. Yes, the same skill
that Captain Jack had that heals a sizable amount of HP. Not good at all.

Another thing you shouldn't do is use a reflect spell or item like
Tetrakarn or a Magic Mirror. She will use Diarahan if you do, which is
of course a full heal.

¯¯¯
• Drake Tiamat fusion is unlocked.

You'll get [Salt Lump], [EM: Fornax]. The main mission Fornax's Exotic Matter
is completed, and you'll automatically go back to the Red Sprite.

... and of course, a new sector opens. On to Grus.

- Grus 1F

Looks a lot like the lower sections of Antlia with different colors here.
Anyway, avoid the space manipulation device here for now-- the angel won't
let you use it anyway.

This floor is full of "illusions" that when you approach, may either go away
or disappear. In actuality, they are either walls or just open passageways
that reveal themselves as you get close to them. If they won't open, it's
just a wall.

There really isn't much to do on this floor-- you can explore and find a
portal in the northwest that'll only open if you have Gate Search E from
the Ame no Uzume EX Mission earlier, behind which you can find rare Forma
[Cornucopia]. This rare forma becomes [Unlock E] Main App back at the Lab.

If you're having trouble finding this door, it's almost right next to a
Strike Team member corpse where you can find the black box for this sector
if you're on the Black box retrieval II EX Mission.

In the northeast is another similar portal that'll only open for Gate Search E
which has [Bead of Life x1] behind it, but aside from that all you can do now
is go explore until you meet Mastema again and see the scene after which
you'll get called back to the Red Sprite.

A new main mission will be added and you'll have to do the same thing here,
regardless of your choices you make at this point.
Your choice to Jimenez and Zelenin's questions affects alignments, though.

"You're ready to rock, right?"
• Let's lock and load. (Chaos)
• We should wait and see. (Neutral)

"Please, [main character's last name]..."
• All right. (Law)
• Out of the question. (Neutral)

• Mission: Pacify Jack's Squad

If you got the Cornucopia earlier, it'll become the [Unlock E] Main App.
Note that Unlock E isn't an "ultimate" unlocker app that'll open up any
door-type portal, it's simply used to open up E-type locked door portals.

Head back into Grus and this time use the space manipulation device near the
entrance to shift on over. The angel will let you.

Phase Shift over. In the Phase Shifted area, you're going to have to deal
with a simplistic teleport maze. In the area with the terminal and Heal Spot,
loop around and take the teleport positioned just about south from the
heal spot.

Here, if you are Law aligned, you may follow the path around to the north
and enter a room for a treasure [Ma Incense x1]. Otherwise, simply go a few
tiles north of where you entered to teleport to a new destination.

Head straight south until you hit a wall, then turn east and go east 2 tiles,
south 2 tiles, then go west and loop around to a door. Inside, grab the
[Mahama Stone x2]. Head back to where you teleported into this area, and then
from there go south until you hit the wall, east until the wall, north to the
wall, then east again. Explore the areas beyond this point until you hit a
teleport. Note that if you went into a door here and found an angel that
won't let you pass, you shouldn't worry about it. That's New Game+ content.

Now, here, follow the path but avoid going into a north dead end or you'll
be teleported back to the terminal and heal spot from earlier and need to
backtrack. You'll run into Mastema. Make your choices during this scene and
note another SMT1-like moment, like what occured with Law Hero, if you've
played that game.

Your choice during the scene can affect alignment.

"What do you think of my rebirth?"
• It's beautiful. (Law)
• It's awe-inspiring (Neutral)
• No problems here. (Chaos)

Now you can take the way out via the teleport I told you to avoid earlier.

Go back to the Red Sprite. Now head to Jack's Squad HQ after the scene.

In Jack's Squad HQ, go to the Lightning for another scene.
The main mission Pacify Jack's Squad is now completed.
Jimenez will give you the [Giant's Fang] rare Forma during the scene.
Take it to the lab. Phase Shifter will be upgraded to [Phase Shifter B].

Which of course means you can now access another area at the space
manipulation points. In Grus, use the space manipulation device and go
to phast shift to area B.

Now explore this area. Yeah, another teleport maze is ahead in order to
continue. Nothing serious though, just like on the side with the angels.

After the first teleport, you can take the right teleporter for
[Mamudo Stone x2] or the left to continue. At the left teleporter, there's
only one way you can go to continue. After the teleport there,
take the first left and go into the door on the left in the hallway.

In this room, you can talk to Grendel about Maya, and he'll ask you to do
something. What you answer here can be a minor alignment shift...

"Sound good?"
• Sure. (Chaos)
• I refuse. (Law)
• Let me think. (Neutral)

... but does not actually reflect your choice on what to do to proceed.
He will tell you to return to the ship and talk it out "as humans do" first.

West and north of Grendel's room are doors that will only open for
you if you are Chaos aligned and have items behind them-- [St Incense x1] and
[Megido Stone x1]. Step on the teleport near Grendel's room to return right
next to the terminal of this floor. You'll meet Jimenez here next to the
terminal for a short scene with him.

Return to the entrance to the sector and a scene with Zelenin will take place,
with another choice.

• By all means, sing. (Law)
• That won't be necessary. (Chaos)
• Let me think. (Neutral)

Again though, here this choice has no impact on what you will actually do.
You should return to the Red Sprite.

You must make your decision here about what to do to lower the barrier so that
you can reach Maya. The choices do affect your alignment, but has nothing to
do with determining your ending path.

They are...

"Should we accept the demons' terms?"
• We should. (Chaos)
• We shouldn't. (Neutral)

(if you select "We shouldn't"...)

"Should we request her assistance?"
• We should. (Law)
• We shouldn't. (Neutral)

These are simply alignment choices, however...

Your actions determine what you do.

You may choose the Law choice to have Zelenin sing by talking to her at the
Grus entrance and asking for her to sing. Then you must head toward Grendel's
room, and an event will take place.

You may choose the Neutral approach by talking to Grendel and then choosing
to force it open by fighting him. He's actually not much harder than the
random encounter Grendel, so uh, no need to really write anything about this.

You may choose the Chaos choice to kill Jack's Squad. You need to go to
Jack's Squad HQ and go to where the Lightning ship is, where you'll have to
fight Ryan.

< Boss: Human Ryan >

It's the same as the Jack fight, except he has less HP and no Pisaca demons.

¯¯¯
Report back to Grendel after you kill Ryan if you do this.

- Grus 1F

Whichever method you choose, the barrier in the southern part of the Grus 1F
phase shift B area will go away if you go inspect the door. Go beyond the door
for a scene with Gore, then continue on and Gore will send you the location of
Maya via comm. Go down the stairs beyond.

- Grus B1F

Go straight ahead and use the terminal in plain sight. Hope you like teleports
and conveyors. That's what this part is about. When you first come to the
conveyors, ride the one going north, which will drop through a teleporter.
Follow the path here to more conveyors, then take the west one.
When it stops, again take the west one and go through the door.
Grab the box with [Revival Bead x2] and then get onto the conveyor again.
When it stops, go onto the east conveyor this time. You'll teleport at the
end of it.

Loop around here until you come to a fork. Take the west path and go down the
stairs you'll reach.

- Grus B2F

Teleport maze time! Take the west teleport. You'll be in a room with a
terminal. Use it if you want and take the teleport east of it.
Ahead is some damage tile floors. In the northwest part of the patch is a
gate-type portal that you can access. Open it up and go through.
You'll now be in another spot with teleports. Take the south one.

From your immediate location, go into the west and east rooms to grab
[Balm of Rising x2] and [Criticker x1]. Outside those rooms, go north
until you're at a fork and don't move. Now take the paths west and east of
the fork to get [Chakra Pot x1] and [Dis-Stone x3]. At the fork, go north
now to teleport.

Now go back up the stairs to 1F, directly to your south.

- Grus B1F

Explore the rest of this area to teleport back to the beginning of the
conveyor area here on B1F. Ride the north conveyor again, but when you
teleport this time take the east conveyor afterwards, which drops you
onto a teleport. At its destination...

You can use the terminal you come across if you wish, then ride the
conveyor to the west of it, then ride the small north conveyor and go through
the door. You'll automatically ride a conveyor. Go through the door in plain
view after it stops. Loop around this area and go through the door, and you'll
automatically ride yet another conveyor. Go through the door after it.
Now a fork.

Go north 3 tiles and east through the door. Don't move, then grab the box
with [Bead x3]. Head back through the door and go north to hit a teleporter.
Go 2 tiles south now without touching the conveyors to hit another teleport.
Now go north through this hallway and through the door. Turn north and open
the box for [Bead of Life x1], then step on the conveyor and make your way
through explored territory until the fork before I told you to go north and
grab the Bead x3 box at before. Stop there then go west this time to hit a
conveyor that will drop you on a teleport this time.

Loop your way around until you reach a fork in the road, and take the south.
Go down the stairs when you reach them.

- Grus B2F

More teleports. Take the east one, then go down the stairs.

- Grus B3F

One way door maze! Not cool because this one is actually somewhat complex.
From the entrance, take them in this order: south, south, south then go up
the stairs.

- Grus B2F

To begin, step on the east teleport here. Now, go to your west and at the
dead end search the north wall for a portal, and go on through it. Grab the
[Soma x2] box and get out of this room. Back here, you can either go up the
stairs to B1F and open a shortcut to the beginning of Grus B1F if you'd like,
or take the teleport to the south to go back to stairs down to B3F. Open up the
shortcut if you'd like, then use the south teleport and go back down the stairs
to B3F.

- Grus B3F

Take doors in the following order: West, west, north, west, south, west.
Go up the stairs.

- Grus B2F

Take the teleport to the west to begin here. Now, loop around this by going
south, then east, then north, ignoring the first west fork you come across.
You'll come to a terminal. Northeast of the terminal is a teleport. Take it.
Now take the north teleporter here. All you can do in the next part is go west
to teleport. Now here, take the first east to the end and teleport.

Go west to teleport, then take the east teleport. Ride the conveyor, and when
it stops go east instead of north to teleport. Go all the way east now and
search the south wall for a portal, and go through. Grab the [Ag Incense x1]
from the box and then go back outside the door. Take the north teleport.
Ride the conveyor and look around. There'll be a terminal. West of the
terminal is a teleport. Use it.

All you can do is go east a bit to teleport. Afterwards, take the south
teleport. Now take the east one. Small strip, so just go east to teleport.
Take the south teleport. Ride the conveyor, and when it stops go west instead
of north to teleport. Loop around here and take the first west you come to.
Go down the stairs to the south.

- Grus B3F

One-way door maze again. From where you are, take the doors; north, east,
south, east, north, east, north, north, west, south. Now go up the stairs.

- Grus B2F

Search this area. Real simplistic. You will find a rare Forma [Remedium] in
the north end. Take it and go up the stairs to the far south.

- Grus B1F

Go northwest and through a door. Don't move when you go through, but turn
north and open up a box for [Amrita Shower x1]. Now go back down the stairs
the way you came in, use the nearby terminal and warp out to the Red Sprite.

The rare Forma Remedium becomes [Unlock C] at the Lab.

Head back down to Grus B1F and from the first terminal, take a north.
You can now unlock that door. Do so and head through.
Unlock the next door on the east wall and go through to grab
[Dekunda Stone x2]. Now go down the easily accessible stairs to B2F.

From here, take the stairs north of where you found the Remedium rare forma.
Open the door here on B1F and go up the now accessible stairs to 1F.

- Grus 1F

Powerful demon detected! Save and heal here if you need, then head in.
You will need preferably powerful physical demons or demons of the same
alignment who have a regular attack of the Gun type, or Gun attribute
attack skills. Phys resistance is good, as is an accessory that prevents
being Stoned. Dekaja is good to remove her annoying buff that makes it hard
to hit her. You could use Dekaja Stones if you'd like, if you have some.
Luster Candy couldn't hurt either.

... but if you're lazy and have deep pockets, here are some passwords.

< Boss: Night Maya >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 6000 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse <

Never use a Gun elemental skill or an elemental or almighty spell. She will
counter with an instant-kill that is neither Expel nor Curse and is 100%
effective meaning game over if you attack that way with your main character.
Regular gun attribute attack skills are fine. Just not stuff like Gust Shot
or whatever that would actually be an elemental or almighty attribute.

When she uses Illusory Ritual, a skill that says it's doubled her agility,
you need to Dekaja or it'll be much harder to hit her. It does wear off,
but she will recast it the turn after it does.

Either use the gun-type regular attack demons to trigger Co-Op, or use
powerful physical skills.

Her abilities are the aforementioned Illusory Ritual, Ultraviolence, a
powerful hit-all physical skill and all four single target -dyne regular
elemental spells as well as more powerful elemental spells such as
Agi Gate, Bufu Gate etc.

Finally, there's a skill she uses called Evil Vortex that does damage and
can cause Stone status. If it hits your MC with Stone status, that's game
over, friend. Make yourself a Supple Ring if you find this to be problematic.

Having Luster Candy is helpful. Buff yourself to +3 because at +4 she
will use Dekaja. War Cry, Tarunda, Rakunda, and Acid Breath or just
Debilitate are useful lowering her damage and her defense, but again no
more than -3 on the Atk and Def parameters, or she'll Dekunda them off.

At +3 agility parameter on your party, you do stand a decent chance of
hitting her even when she has Illusory Ritual up.

If you're not using gun attack skills to trigger Co-Ops with your main
character, the Murakumo Clone sword for the main character is a good choice
as it may occasionally charm her.

This fight isn't too hard with the correct preparation, but can go bad if
you're unlucky and don't have Stone protected for example.

¯¯¯
• Night Maya fusion is unlocked.

You will get [Sweet Liqueur] and [EM: Grus].
The main mission Grus's Exotic Matter is completed.

A lot of scenes will play. A whole lot. It's getting real.

- Horologium 1F

Just a warning, but if you are planning on being Law or Chaos, then I
recommend you set yourself up with demons that are strong or better to
Phys and Gun with good buffs/debuffs and elemental spells because you're
going to have one hell of a boss fight coming up here.

If you bought the Law/Chaos teams I supplied for Maya above, though, they
should suffice as they have all that's needed to win.
The Law team doesn't have any physical/gun resistance, but they have
the debuffs, buffs and heals needed. I blame the lack of good Law
demons in that level range.

I would highly recommend using the Goblin alignment trick right now if
you want a specific alignment path ending or to do any alignment-specific
EX Missions like the 4th one for the angels or heavenly kings in Eridanus.
As in right now, before you do anything in Horologium. You will not be able
to change your alignment at all after the first events in there.

You cannot do anything here in Horologium for now aside from head north
to the elevator. Ride it down to its only destination, B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Try to enter the door just south of you to meet Gore. Scene time.
During the scenes, you'll automatically return to the Red Sprite.

Here, you will make your choice as to who you will support.

If you are far-leaning Law, you are locked into the Law path automatically.

If you are Law, but not very far into Law, you will get these choices:

"Will you sing God's eternal praise?"
• I will. (Stay Law and locked into Law path)
• I won't. (Go to next question)

"Who would you entrust the future to?"
• The human race. (Alignment shift to Neutral and locked into Neutral path)
• The god of law and order. (Stay Law and locked into Law path)

If you are Neutral, you will get the following choices:

"Would you host a demon in yourself?"
• I would. (Alignment shift to Chaos and locked into Chaos path)
• I wouldn't. (Stay Neutral and go to next question)

"Will you sing God's eternal praise?"
• I will. (Alignment shift to Law and locked into Law path)
• I won't. (Stay Neutral and go to next question)

"Who would you entrust the future to?"
• The human race. (Stay Neutral and locked into Neutral path)
• A just, righteous God. (Alignment shift to Chaos and locked into Chaos path)

If you are Chaos but not far-leaning, you will get these choices:

"Would you host a demon in yourself?"
• I would. (Stay Chaos and locked into Chaos path)
• I wouldn't. (Go to next question)

"Who would you entrust the future to?"
• The human race. (Alignment shift to Neutral and locked into Neutral path)
• The free demons. (Stay Chaos and locked into Chaos path)

If you are far into Chaos, you are locked into the Chaos path automatically.

Dialogues will slightly differ based on your current alignment, and your
choice determines your ending as well as some bosses, events and available
EX Missions. Once chosen, you will not be able to change your alignment
again until you begin a New Game or New Game+.

Make your choice if possible, and continue using the Walkthroughs below for
each path. On Law and Chaos paths, you will have to fight Gore because he
doesn't quite agree with those ideologies that to him are giving up on the
infinite potential and future he's seen in humanity with his ubergestalt
powers or whatever. That's why I said to prepare a group that resists or
better to phys/gun and has good buffs/debuffs and elemental spells a bit
earlier if you plan on being Law or Chaos.

Walkthrough: Sector Horologium - Neutral Path [SJ_WALK-H_N]
/******************\*\*******************\_******************\*\*******************\
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

By choosing the Neutral path, you choose to fight for the freedom and future
of humanity. Commander Gore gives you the rare Forma [Clement Bell] and the
power to see Mem Aleph's true form, then disappears.

Arthur is reactivated and issues new orders.

• Mission: Bomb Materials Retrieval

Talk to Kato in the Command Room for more info on the locations of the
Cosmic Eggs. Take the Clement Bell to the Lab and get the [Unlock D] function
for your DEMONICA. At the Deck, a Strike Team member reports that the
elevator in Horologium is busted and Arthur suggests that you should focus on
the other matters for now.

For now, we need to collect the bomb materials. Head into Antlia.

- Antlia

On 1F, go to the north end of the floor and unlock the door that opens to your
new Unlock D function. Very straight-forward area. When you reach the C-type
dark areas (yellow), go through the middle door and look for the exit east,
along the south wall. Save at the terminal here, then search the wall to the
east for a portal and go through.

You'll meet Wu Kong and have to fight him.

---

< Boss: Fury Wu Kong >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1300 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Ice, Elec / St: Fire / Nu: Phys, Gun, Expel, Curse <

Just use attacks that are not Phys, Fire, Gun, Expel, or Curse on him.
Preferably Ice and Elec for Demon Co-Ops if you'd like. He doesn't have
much HP. I killed him in two turns with the Elec shot from my gun and added
demon Co-Ops.

¯¯¯
You get [Cosmic Egg #1] for winning. Leave Antlia now. Go to Carina.

- Carina

Go up to 2F and phase shift over to dimension B at the south device.
Work your way north and go through the door unlocked with the Unlock D App.
Save your game at the terminal here, then search for a portal south of the
terminal. Go through.

You will meet and have to fight Zhu Yin.

---

< Boss: Dragon Zhu Yin >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1400 / MP: 9999 ]

> St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse <

Simply fire away with Physicals or non-gun attacks. He, like Wu Kong, has
very little HP and should die in a few turns. Keep your HP high though, as
he knows Megido spells. Buff and debuff spells are worthless as Zhu Yin knows
Silent Prayer which removes all buffs and debuffs on both sides.

¯¯¯
After the fight, you acquire [Cosmic Egg #3].

You can leave Carina now, or you can explore the phase shift B areas on 2F
and 3F to pickup some items -- [Great Chakra x1], [Bead Chain x1],
[Bead of Life x1] and [Amrita Shower x2] and THEN leave Carina!

Go to Delphinus next.

- Delphinus 1F

On 1F, you can now open the locked door near Kudlak. More conveyors.
Ride the one of the west two to the north, then go east and search for a
portal. Go through and hit the switch, then go back out and ride the conveyor
to your north. Follow at the turn ahead, go straight south until you stop,
then go west and ride the westmost conveyor. When that conveyor stops, search
west for a portal and go through it.

Now ride the conveyor north, flip the switch to change the directions of the
conveyors back to normal, and ride the conveyor back south, going through
the secret door you just opened. Go south down the conveyor, then east past
the next conveyor, and after you turn going north, go onto the first conveyor
you reach. Go south when that conveyor stops.

You can now use an elevator and open up a short back to the beginning of the
floor south of the elevator. Take the elevator up to 9F.

- Delphinus 9F

Search for a portal to the southwest and go through it.
In this hallway, there are portals to the west. One going north and one south.
Through the south, [Great Chakra x1]. Through the north, a path to a terminal.
West of the terminal, search the south wall for a portal. Go through.

You will meet and have to fight Divine Cherub.

---

< Boss: Divine Cherub >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1200 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Elec / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Wind <

Another LOW hp "boss." Use Elec attacks for max efficiency with Co-Ops, or
just physical/gun attribute skills. You'll win in like 3 rounds tops.
He does know Megidola and Mahamaon, though by wearing most armors, the
Hama skill can't touch you.

¯¯¯
You get [Cosmic Egg #4]. Leave Delphinus. Enter Bootes.

- Bootes

Take the elevators in the palace up to 6F. Open the door next to you with the
Unlock D function and ride the elevator beyond it up to 8F. Grab the
[Soma x2] to the south then go through the door here.
Take the door in the southeast of this big room, then go east to the terminal
and save. Go north of the terminal, and down the stairs.

Search just south of you for a portal, and go through. Choose to search the
area here to get [Nuke Warhead]. Zelenin is here, and you will have to fight
her...

If you're using my Neutral team that worked for Maya, it will also work just
fine right here. No need for new passwords.

---

< Boss: Judge Zelenin >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 7700 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Wind / St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Elec <

Her attacks as as follows:

Wave of Death, a hit-all physical similar in power to Hades Blast.
Megido Storm, an Elec spell that hits all.
Right Hand, which heals her for over 300 HP and raises all of her battle
statistics (Attack, Def, Agility). Counter it with Debilitate or Dekaja.
Sinner's Song, which causes almighty damage and can charm those it hits--
she won't use it until her HP is low.

Her regular attack also hits all.

The best strategy here is concentrate on buff and debuff spells.
Luster Candy is great for buffs, but don't exceed +3 or she'll Dekaja.
Debilitate you can get from Thoth or Rangda sources, two demons you may have
fused so far -- Thoth being much lower leveled. It is the debuff equivalent
of Luster Candy. Again, do not stack past -3 or she'll Dekunda herself.

When she uses Right Hand, counter it with Debilitate to drop her stats down
to -3 again. Use physical or non-elec magic attribute attacks or use Wind to
trigger Co-Ops. With the buffs and debuffs up, she's almost too easy.

¯¯¯
You get [Cosmic Egg #2] for winning, and the Bomb Materials Retrieval mission
is now at an end. Now return to the Red Sprite.

- Horologium 1F

Go into Horologium and try to ride the now-fixed elevator. Skadi will
destroy it and you will have to fight her.

---

< Boss: Lady Skadi >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1600 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Fire / Nu: Expel, Curse / Dr: Ice <

She has very little HP as well. What's with these easy bosses? Take her out
with physicals, gun skills, or Fire attacks. Just make sure your Main Char
is not weak to Ice.

¯¯¯
You'll get the [Destiny Jewel] rare Forma after the battle. Take it back to
the Red Sprite's Lab to get the [Gate Search D] function. Now head back into
Horologium.

Take the door east of the entrance, and search for a portal in this hall.
Through it is a dark area. Go west as far as you can, north as far as you can
then south as far as you can, then east two tiles and north two tiles. Go
through the door.

Here, take the portal in the far west to get into a new dark area. In this
one, go north all the way, east all the way, north all the way, east all the
way, then through the door. Ride the elevator here.

B1F has a terminal past some annoying ailment/damage fields, but for now is
also a dead end.
B4F has a heal point and some damage/ailment fields, but for now is also a
dead end.
Go down to B2F to continue.

- Horologium B2F

Search for an obvious portal to get things going here. It's a linear area.
No real puzzling things must be done to traverse it. Go west until you reach
an elevator and ride it down to B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Go south into the poison fields, then east, and when you get to the fork,
go south. In the damage tiles, go east until you reach a door and go through
to get [Summon Stone x1]. Then back in the damage tile patch, go all the way
west and search for a portal and go through it. Now the path is clear to get
to an elevator. Go up to 1F.

- Horologium 1F

Search the wall to the southeast to open up a shortcut to the very entrance
of Horologium. Ignore the stairs as there's only access to an EX Mission
from Barong by traversing all of the C-type dark areas down there, and you
can't see in C-type dark areas yet.

Go back into the elevator and down to B3F.

- Horologium B3F

Go east and open the portal on the wall. Go east until you reach a fork, then
turn and go up the northwest path. Near the end of this path, search the south
wall to find a portal. Open it up and go through to get [30000 Macca] and
[Bead Chain x1]. Leave the room via the only door. Now go back to the central
part of this floor, and take the south path this time. You will reach a
Heal Spot and terminal. if you search the west wall 3 tiles above the terminal
you can find a portal. Go through it and get [Soma x2] and [Great Chakra x1].

Go east of the terminal and up the stairs.

- Horologium B2F

Annoying, annoying floor full of conveyors. Take them in the following order
if you want [Chakra Pot x1]:

Southmost, west, east, northwest, west, north, east, east, east, then east
four tiles south of where that conveyors ends up. Go north 3 tiles of where
this one ends up, then go east to the wall. Go south two tiles, then east to
and ride the next conveyor. Go south three tiles, then east to the wall, south
to the wall, west one tile, then south onto the conveyor. When this one stops,
go two tiles west then step onto the conveyor. Now, go east to the wall, then
south onto the conveyor. When this one stops, avoid all conveyors and find
your way to a treasure box. You will get the Chakra Pot. You can ride the
next conveyor to get back to the start of the floor.

Take them in the following order to take a pitfall back to an area of B3F you
can't access elsewhere and get [50000 Macca] from:

Southmost, west, east, northwest, west, north, east, east, east, then east
four tiles south of where that conveyors ends up. Go north 3 tiles of where
this one ends up, then go east to the wall. Go south two tiles, then east to
and ride the next conveyor. Go north and ride the conveyor. When it stops,
search north for a portal and go through. In here, search the west wall for a
portal and go through it. You will ride a conveyor into a pitfall to B3F.

In the west path here in this room, you can find a box at the end with the
promised 50000 Macca. The south path from that room leads back to a portal
which will open right near the terminal on B3F and therefore the stairs back
up to B2F.

Take them in this order to proceed in the dungeon:

Southmost, west, east, northwest, west, north, east, east, east, then east
four tiles south of where that conveyors ends up. Go north 3 tiles of where
this one ends up, then go east to the wall. Go south two tiles, then east to
and ride the next conveyor. Go south three tiles, then east to the wall, south
to the wall, west one tile, then south onto the conveyor. From here, go west
and ride the west conveyor. You can now access a terminal and stairs up to
B1F.

- Horologium B1F

Very small area. Just loop around and take the stairs down to B2F.

- Horologium B2F

Literally all you can do in this 1 tile area is take the stairs down.

- Horologium B3F

A very linear pathway. You can find a terminal and a heal spot near the
stairs leading down to B4F. Go down.

- Horologium B4F

Head past the D-type locked door, and go east in the hallway there.
Go through the one-way door on the north wall.
This is a big room with 6 doors, 3 on the east, 3 on the west.
Loiter around the northwest-most door until the Moon Phase reads 7/8 and is
about to turn Full. Go inside, and two tiles west to teleport.
If the moon phase is NOT full yet, go north one til, south one tile until it
is full. When it hits full, go south all the way to teleport elsewhere.

In this room, unlock and go through both the east and west doors.
Go through the west door to continue. You will come across a set of three
doors here. Go through the middle one, then down the small hallway past it
to teleport again.

Go directly east and search for a portal. This will unlock a shortcut to this
area, and you can find a terminal and Heal Spot beyond. Save, heal, then go
back west. You can find in this area [Balm of Rising x2], an elevator, and
stairs down.

Use the elevator which leads to 1F. On 1F, you can unlock yet another shortcut
to Horologium's very entrance. Go back down. Save and heal, and get ready for
a boss battle. The best armor to wear is the "Armor Vest" which is Strong
against Phys, Gun, and Curse while weak against Elec. The next boss uses
Phys and Gun primarily, with some Fire. Have demons with the standard setup
of buffs/debuff like Luster Candy, Debilitate and go down the stairs.

Here are some passwords if needed. They likely won't be cheap.

- Horologium B5F

Attempt to go forward and a scene will trigger with Jimenez. You will now
have to eliminate Jimenez because, well, he let the power go to his head
and now wants to kill you.

[ HP: 9000 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Gun or Ice or Elec or Wind\* / Nu: Expel, Curse / Dr: Fire <

    * Random, may change each turn.

This fight can be won similarly to the Zelenin fight. Buffs/debuffs are king,
but again do not go past +3/-3 or Jimenez will remove them.

Jimenez is serious business. If you're not strong to Gun, he may one shot
you with his Chaos Tack skill.

His regular attack hits all targets.

Chaos Tack is a random target Gun skill which is ludicrously powerful. Those
not strong or better to Gun may be one shotted by it before a lot of buffs
and debuffs are applied.

Hellfire is a strong fire spell that hits all.

Left Hand is basically Luster Candy. Remove with Dekaja or use Debilitate
to offset it by as much as it adds.

Shuffler has a chance to inflict Bomb status on everyone. Dis-Bomb item or
Bomdi or Salvation spells will get rid of it.

Dark Matter is high almighty damage to all. He will use it at low HP or on
the turn after if you use a reflective spell or item like Attack Mirror or
Makarakarn, etc. He'll also use it every turn if you let him use Left Hand
all the way to +4, but that shouldn't really ever happen.

Basically buff up with Luster Candy or Rakukaja and debuff him with Tarunda or
Debilitate, then use physicals or Gun/Ice/Elec/Wind spells and hope you hit
the weakness for Demon Co-Ops. He shouldn't be too hard, but if going for
Co-Ops then be aware that his weakness can change at pretty much any time.

¯¯¯
Scene after the fight, then continue.

Go northwest and when you're as far west as you can go, try to walk out south
onto "nothingness" to reveal a hidden path which leads to [Bead x2] in a box.
Then continue back north. Yeah. A "new" dungeon element-- hidden paths.
Some of them give hints as to where you should walk, while some don't.

When you reach an apparent dead end in the center of the floor, try to walk
east in the middle of the platform for a hidden path. When you reach yet
another apparent dead end, go south. On this path you can go east, to another
dead end. Go south, then east, then south on the nothingness to reach a
platform with some stairs leading up to B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Search this small area of 4F to acquire rare Forma [Gumonji Mirror].
This can be taken back to the Lab to get the [Enemy Search C] Main App.
With it, you can now find even more types of Hidden enemies and Fiends.
Go back down to B5F.

- Horologium B5F

At the dead end before the one leading to the stairs, go north then
east to reveal more hidden paths. Then north, east, and north.
One tile west, turn north and you can reveal a hidden path leading to a box
with [Soma x2]. Back on the main path, head west, north, west, north, west.

Here at the dead end path that looks like the floor's entrance, go south,
then west, then north to reach stairs down.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way through this simple maze with the blocks that pop up as you
approach them. A portal is accessible in the southwest. Go through it.

Here, go west 2 tiles, south 3, east 1, then south onto the invisible walkway.

On it, go south, then west, then south. Go all the way south, and turn east
when you can. Go 4 tiles east from when you turned east, then turn north and
go north two. A Forma should appear on your map. Loop around to the north
side of the forma then go south to grab it. It's [Raven Stone] and will
turn into the [Visualizer C] Main App that lets you see in the yellow color
"Type C" dark areas. Go back to the hidden gate opened earlier, just past
the maze area where the red walls pop up.

From it, head one tile west, then north and you'll step into a hidden area.
It's a maze of sorts. Head north until you teleport. Now, you'll have to
nagigate an annoying teleporter maze here where all teleports lead to the
same area and you want to avoid them all.

The solution to it is, from the teleport's destination:

5 tiles west, 1 north, 1 west, 1 north, 2 west, 2 south, 1 east, 1 south,
1 east, 1 south, 1 east, 3 south, 2 west, 2 north, and go through the
elevator door. Take it down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleport here in this small area, and use it to reach the east
side of B9F. Ride the elevator here back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Go all the way west and open the portal and go through it. Go two tiles
north and search east to find a portal, and go through it. Follow this path
to some stairs down to B7F.

- Horologium B7F

Follow the small path here through the door and hit the switch at the end of
the path. Go back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Ride the elevator back down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleporter in this small area back to the west side of B9F, and then
ride the elevator back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way, again, to the gate near where the maze with popping up red
walls is. From it, loop around to a D-type locked door to the south and
go through it. Another red walls popping up area here.

In the south is a terminal and heal spot. Look for a portal on the east
wall to the northeast, and go through it. Search for yet another portal
on the east wall in this new hallway, and go through.

To your east, you can find a box with [Megidola Stone x1]. To the far
south is an elevator down, while to the southwest, behind a D-type locked
door is a switch to get rid of the red walls that pop up. Hit the switch.

The elevator can be rode down to B7F which is useless for now as a portal
opens from the other side of the wall later, and to 1F where you can now open
up a shortcut to right near the beginning of Horologium. Do what you need then
find the stairs down next to the terminal here on B6F and go down.

- Horologium B7F

Open the door to the north and go through. Yeah, new type of area.
Invisible WALLS. This makes it annoying to navigate. Go north until you
hit a wall, then east until you hit a wall. South then west from here is
[Sacrifice x1] in a box. Now go back east, then north until you hit a wall.

From here, west until you reach a door on the north wall. Open it, go through
and hit the switch then go back into the room with invisible walls.
Work your way south and west and you'll hit a space manipulation device.
Time to go to other areas.

Phase Shift to type A. Work your way around in this area to the northwest
and go through the door. Follow this path until you reach a switch. Hit it.
Go back and Phase Shift B at the device. Work your way around the northeast
side of this room then go south to get [Great Chakra x1]. In the southeast
end, go through the door.

In the southeast end here, you can open up a shortcut to the elevator that
connects with B6F and 1F. To the north, a terminal and heal spot. Just west
of that terminal, a portal you can open to get [Bead of Life x1].

Go back and phase shift back to the original space, then in the room with
the space manipulation device, take the north exit. Here, go all the way
north and you'll find some stairs down. West of those stairs, a terminal
and heal spot. Use them if needed, then head down.

If you can't get past the rock in the middle of the hall to get to the stairs
it's because you didn't hit all of the switches on each side of the rock
(west, south, and east). You probably missed the east one, which is accessed
from stairs down in the northeast part of B6F.

- Horologium B8F

Literally head straight south and go down the stairs. You can deviate to
pickup some forma if you want, but this isn't a complicated floor.

- Horologium B9F

Explore the northwest to find [Sacrifice x1] and [Bead of Life x1].
Explore the northeast to find [Amrita Shower x2] and a terminal and
heal spot. This is the final save point. Do all of the EX Missions
and gear and forma grinding/level grinding/fusion you need to.

West of the terminal is a portal. Go through it. You are now in the area
of B9F you accessed earlier and met Gore in. Obviously, the big room there
houses Mem Aleph. Equip your Main Character with the Gibo Eyes Sub App if you
happen to have it, then go in when ready.

You will want to create a party of mixed alignments with powerful attack
and healing skills.

If you want some premade demons and are prepared to probably farm up a lot
of money, here is a full varied alignment team that will destroy the
final boss without much trouble.

< Boss: Mother Mem Aleph >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 7300 / MP: 9999 ]

> Nu: Gun, Expel, Curse <

This is the final boss.

She has hit-all elemental spells, Asura's "Asura Roga", Ouroboros' ailment
skill "Disaster Cycle", "Mother's Kiss" - a 6-8 hit physical skill, and
"Reason's Start" which removes all buffs and debuffs from both sides and then
heals her for around 600 HP. Great Flood, which does damage to all party
members and lowers your Agility battle statistic by -1.

This boss is serious. You need serious damage output and healing skills to
match it. Buff/debuff spells aren't so hot here because of Reason's Start.
You'll need to spam your demon's strongest spells.

Jihad is a highly recommended skill, though it comes only from very high level
demon's source. High tier elemental and/or almighty skills work too.

Make sure your MC is equipped with the best armor you have, preferably the
Dragon Vest from the Fafnir EX mission, and the accessory that will revive
you once per battle should you die, Dragon Ring. Keep your MC healthy.
At all times.

¯¯¯
When you win, another fight.

---

< Boss: Empty Mem Aleph >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 9000 / MP: 9999 ]
Six random sets of resists, changes each turn.

> Wk: Phys / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Elec, Wind <
> Wk: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Phys, Wind <
> Wk: Fire / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Phys, Gun <
> Wk: Ice / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Gun, Fire <
> Wk: Elec / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Fire, Ice <
> Wk: Wind / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Ice, Elec <

Same skills as last time, plus two more. One is named Mem Aleph, and it
will return all demons of a randomly chosen alignment to your stock.
This is why you need a varied team in alignment. Second is called simply MA,
and it will do an amount of damage equal to the target's current HP and heal
Mem Aleph by that amount. This is primarily why you wear the Dragon Ring.
It will save you from death from this once if you are the target of it.

The changing resists is why you equip the Gibo Eyes Sub App. It lets you see
what is ineffective and by proxy, what is effective.

This fight is exactly like the last one except for the addition of new
attacks on her part. She just has more HP. Use the same strategy and mind
the target cursor each turn for the resist changes.

If Mem Aleph or MA is used, revive/summon the demon back or better yet if
your demons have the Sabbatma or Invitation skills, use those to help get the
party back up and running. Don't be afraid to use some heavy restoration
items, but don't go crazy because they do carry over to a second cycle.

¯¯¯
After you win, that's it. The Neutral ending plays and you're given a choice
to save your game to play through again with bonuses while you keep many of
the things you've earned.

Walkthrough: Sector Horologium - Law Path [SJ_WALK-H_L]
/******************\*\*******************\_******************\*\*******************\
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

So you've chosen to side with the God of Law and Order, YHVH, Yahweh or
whatever you wish to call him, who apparently either wishes to enslave
humanity by mind control or to create some kind of hivemind that lives in
unity depending on how you see what Mastema and the three wise men are
trying to do. Well, Commander Gore doesn't like this choice, so right away you
have to fight him!

---

< Boss: Meta Gore >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 15000 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Wind / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Phys, Gun <

Gore is a beast. Fortunately, he only uses Physical and Gun attacks.
He has a lot of HP, and is weak to Wind.
A team that is Strong to Phys and/or Gun is good.
Here's his skill set...

Self-Denial -- Heals him for a few hundred HP and has the same effect as
a cast of Tarukaja to boot.

Charge -- Next physical does more than two times as much damage.

Heaven Strike -- Light, random, multiple hits of physical damage.

E.N.D. -- Random physical damage plus chance for Fear status ailment.

Adaptation -- Huge physical damage strike. Seems to only use it after using
Charge and will target the main character with it every time. If you are
not Strong to Phys and not guarding, you will die. I guarantee this.

"Gore is bursting with power!" -- happens automatically once in the fight
and heals him for 7500 HP as well as clearing any debuffs you've stacked
onto him.

Rain Strike -- Heavy, random target gun damage.

You'll want a team that can attack with elemental attacks--preferably Wind--
and has a good number of the same old, same old buffs and debuffs.
Luster Candy or Rakukaja on the buff side and Debilitate or Tarunda/War Cry or
Dekaja on the debuff side.

Main Character should be equipped with an armor that is Strong to Phys and
perhaps Gun -- "Armor Vest" armor is ideal as it is strong to both.
A gun that gives him a wind elemental attack is nice, too, if you're using
same-alignment demons to get Co-Op attacks.

Dekaja is needed to remove the attack buff from Gore's Self-Denial if you're
not using Debilitate, War Cry Tarunda to lower his attack as you probably
should be.

You'll need to use Elemental or Almighty attacks to damage him since he
reflects Phys and Gun. Wind + Co-Ops is nice but you'd probably have to make
a whole new custom team for exploiting that setup.

This is just a long fight. You should have plenty of Chakra Drops however,
and this is a good place to spend them. Gore will heal himself for 7500 HP
one or two times throughout this battle, and Gore himself has the highest
HP of any boss in the game save the ultimate optional boss.

¯¯¯
Zelenin shows up and uses her singing voice on the crew in the scenes
after the battle, and a new Main Mission is added in the following scenes.
The Three Wise Men will give you the rare Forma [Clement Bell], as well.

• Mission: Find the Four Cosmic Eggs

Take the Clement Bell to the Lab to get the [Unlock D] Main App.

Now it's time to collect those Cosmic Eggs. You'll get a notice about the
elevator in Horologium being broken when you go to the deck, but that has
nothing to do with the mission for now. Head into Antlia.

- Antlia

On 1F, go to the north end of the floor and unlock the door that opens to your
new Unlock D function. Very straight-forward area. When you reach the C-type
dark areas (yellow), go through the middle door and look for the exit east,
along the south wall. Save at the terminal here, then search the wall to the
east for a portal and go through.

You'll meet Wu Kong and have to fight him.

---

< Boss: Fury Wu Kong >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1300 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Ice, Elec / St: Fire / Nu: Phys, Gun, Expel, Curse <

Just use attacks that are not Phys, Fire, Gun, Expel, or Curse on him.
Preferably Ice and Elec for Demon Co-Ops if you'd like. He doesn't have
much HP. I killed him in two turns with the Elec shot from my gun and added
demon Co-Ops.

¯¯¯
You get [Cosmic Egg #1] for winning. Leave Antlia now. Go to Bootes.

- Bootes

Take the elevators in the palace up to 6F. Open the door next to you with the
Unlock D function and ride the elevator beyond it up to 8F. Grab the
[Soma x2] to the south then go through the door here.
Take the door in the southeast of this big room, then go east to the terminal
and save. Go north of the terminal, and down the stairs.

Search just south of you for a portal, and go through. Yatagarasu is here,
and will give you the the [Cosmic Egg #2] without a fight.
Now leave Bootes, and go to Carina.

- Carina

Go up to 2F and phase shift over to dimension B at the south device.
Work your way north and go through the door unlocked with the Unlock D App.
Save your game at the terminal here, then search for a portal south of the
terminal. Go through.

You will meet and have to fight Zhu Yin.

---

< Boss: Dragon Zhu Yin >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1400 / MP: 9999 ]

> St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse <

Simply fire away with Physicals or non-gun attacks. He, like Wu Kong, has
very little HP and should die in a few turns. Keep your HP high though, as
he knows Megido spells. Buff and debuff spells are worthless as Zhu Yin knows
Silent Prayer which removes all buffs and debuffs on both sides.

¯¯¯
After the fight, you acquire [Cosmic Egg #3].

You can leave Carina now, or you can explore the phase shift B areas on 2F
and 3F to pickup some items -- [Great Chakra x1], [Bead Chain x1],
[Bead of Life x1] and [Amrita Shower x2] and THEN leave Carina!

Go to Delphinus next.

- Delphinus 1F

On 1F, you can now open the locked door near Kudlak. More conveyors.
Ride the one of the west two to the north, then go east and search for a
portal. Go through and hit the switch, then go back out and ride the conveyor
to your north. Follow at the turn ahead, go straight south until you stop,
then go west and ride the westmost conveyor. When that conveyor stops, search
west for a portal and go through it.

Now ride the conveyor north, flip the switch to change the directions of the
conveyors back to normal, and ride the conveyor back south, going through
the secret door you just opened. Go south down the conveyor, then east past
the next conveyor, and after you turn going north, go onto the first conveyor
you reach. Go south when that conveyor stops.

You can now use an elevator and open up a short back to the beginning of the
floor south of the elevator. Take the elevator up to 9F.

- Delphinus 9F

Search for a portal to the southwest and go through it.
In this hallway, there are portals to the west. One going north and one south.
Through the south, [Great Chakra x1]. Through the north, a path to a terminal.
West of the terminal, search the south wall for a portal. Go through.

You will meet Cherub here, and it will give you [Cosmic Egg #4].
Leave Delphinus afterwards, to the Red Sprite.

The Main Mission "Find the Four Cosmic Eggs" is now complete.

The next objective is to go into Horologium for the final Exotic Matter.

First, though, you may wish to go into Grus and check the room in the 1F
phase shift Sanctum A area where Mastema turned Zelenin into an angel.
There, you'll meet an archangel who will tell you about a ritual that is
going to be performed and mark a spot on your map in Horologium B6F.

- Horologium 1F

Go into Horologium and try to ride the now-fixed elevator. Surt will show up
and destroy it, and you will have to fight him.

---

< Boss: Tyrant Surt >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1500 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Ice / Nu: Expel, Curse / Dr: Fire <

Surt has very little HP. He's weak to Ice and Drains fire. He can cast a
fairly painful Agidyne and his basic physical attack hits twice, but really
unless your main character is weak to Fire, there's no chance of losing this
fight. Honestly. Just kill him with physical, gun, or non-Fire magic.

¯¯¯
You'll get the [Destiny Jewel] rare Forma after the battle. Take it back to
the Red Sprite's Lab to get the [Gate Search D] function. Now head back into
Horologium.

Take the door east of the entrance, and search for a portal in this hall.
Through it is a dark area. Go west as far as you can, north as far as you can
then south as far as you can, then east two tiles and north two tiles. Go
through the door.

Here, take the portal in the far west to get into a new dark area. In this
one, go north all the way, east all the way, north all the way, east all the
way, then through the door. Ride the elevator here.

B1F has a terminal past some annoying ailment/damage fields, but for now is
also a dead end.
B4F has a heal point and some damage/ailment fields, but for now is also a
dead end.
Go down to B2F to continue.

- Horologium B2F

Search for an obvious portal to get things going here. It's a linear area.
No real puzzling things must be done to traverse it. Go west until you reach
an elevator and ride it down to B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Go south into the poison fields, then east, and when you get to the fork,
go south. In the damage tiles, go east until you reach a door and go through
to get [Summon Stone x1]. Then back in the damage tile patch, go all the way
west and search for a portal and go through it. Now the path is clear to get
to an elevator. Go up to 1F.

- Horologium 1F

Search the wall to the southeast to open up a shortcut to the very entrance
of Horologium. Ignore the stairs as there's only access to an EX Mission
from Barong by traversing all of the C-type dark areas down there, and you
can't see in C-type dark areas yet.

Go back into the elevator and down to B3F.

- Horologium B3F

Go east and open the portal on the wall. Go east until you reach a fork, then
turn and go up the northwest path. Near the end of this path, search the south
wall to find a portal. Open it up and go through to get [30000 Macca] and
[Bead Chain x1]. Leave the room via the only door. Now go back to the central
part of this floor, and take the south path this time. You will reach a
Heal Spot and terminal. if you search the west wall 3 tiles above the terminal
you can find a portal. Go through it and get [Soma x2] and [Great Chakra x1].

Go east of the terminal and up the stairs.

- Horologium B2F

Annoying, annoying floor full of conveyors. Take them in the following order
if you want [Chakra Pot x1]:

Southmost, west, east, northwest, west, north, east, east, east, then east
four tiles south of where that conveyors ends up. Go north 3 tiles of where
this one ends up, then go east to the wall. Go south two tiles, then east to
and ride the next conveyor. Go south three tiles, then east to the wall, south
to the wall, west one tile, then south onto the conveyor. When this one stops,
go two tiles west then step onto the conveyor. Now, go east to the wall, then
south onto the conveyor. When this one stops, avoid all conveyors and find
your way to a treasure box. You will get the Chakra Pot. You can ride the
next conveyor to get back to the start of the floor.

Take them in the following order to take a pitfall back to an area of B3F you
can't access elsewhere and get [50000 Macca] from:

Southmost, west, east, northwest, west, north, east, east, east, then east
four tiles south of where that conveyors ends up. Go north 3 tiles of where
this one ends up, then go east to the wall. Go south two tiles, then east to
and ride the next conveyor. Go north and ride the conveyor. When it stops,
search north for a portal and go through. In here, search the west wall for a
portal and go through it. You will ride a conveyor into a pitfall to B3F.

In the west path here in this room, you can find a box at the end with the
promised 50000 Macca. The south path from that room leads back to a portal
which will open right near the terminal on B3F and therefore the stairs back
up to B2F.

Take them in this order to proceed in the dungeon:

Southmost, west, east, northwest, west, north, east, east, east, then east
four tiles south of where that conveyors ends up. Go north 3 tiles of where
this one ends up, then go east to the wall. Go south two tiles, then east to
and ride the next conveyor. Go south three tiles, then east to the wall, south
to the wall, west one tile, then south onto the conveyor. From here, go west
and ride the west conveyor. You can now access a terminal and stairs up to
B1F.

- Horologium B1F

Very small area. Just loop around and take the stairs down to B2F.

- Horologium B2F

Literally all you can do in this 1 tile area is take the stairs down.

- Horologium B3F

A very linear pathway. You can find a terminal and a heal spot near the
stairs leading down to B4F. Go down.

- Horologium B4F

Head past the D-type locked door, and go east in the hallway there.
Go through the one-way door on the north wall.
This is a big room with 6 doors, 3 on the east, 3 on the west.
Loiter around the northwest-most door until the Moon Phase reads 7/8 and is
about to turn Full. Go inside, and two tiles west to teleport.
If the moon phase is NOT full yet, go north one til, south one tile until it
is full. When it hits full, go south all the way to teleport elsewhere.

In this room, unlock and go through both the east and west doors.
Go through the west door to continue. You will come across a set of three
doors here. Go through the middle one, then down the small hallway past it
to teleport again.

Go directly east and search for a portal. This will unlock a shortcut to this
area, and you can find a terminal and Heal Spot beyond. Save, heal, then go
back west. You can find in this area [Balm of Rising x2], an elevator, and
stairs down.

Use the elevator which leads to 1F. On 1F, you can unlock yet another shortcut
to Horologium's very entrance. Go back down. Save and heal, and get ready for
a boss battle. The best armor to wear is the "Armor Vest" which is Strong
against Phys, Gun, and Curse while weak against Elec. The next boss uses
Phys and Gun primarily, with some Fire. Have demons with the standard setup
of buffs/debuff like Luster Candy, Debilitate and go down the stairs.

Here are some password demons if needed. It likely won't be cheap.

- Horologium B5F

Attempt to go forward and a scene will trigger with Jimenez. You will now
have to eliminate Jimenez because, well, he let the power go to his head
and now wants to kill you.

< Boss: Soil Jimenez >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 8000 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Ice\* / St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Dr: Fire <

- May start to drain it as the fight goes on.

Jimenez is serious business. If you're not strong to Gun, he may one shot
you with his Chaos Tack skill.

You'll want to use the standard buff/debuff strategy and keep in mind not
to go past -3 and +3.

His regular attack hits all targets.

Chaos Tack is a random target Gun skill which is ludicrously powerful. Those
not strong or better to Gun may be one shotted by it before a lot of buffs
and debuffs are applied.

Hellfire is a strong fire spell that hits all.

Left Hand is basically Luster Candy. Remove with Dekaja or use Debilitate
to offset it by as much as it adds.

Shuffler has a chance to inflict Bomb status on everyone. Dis-Bomb item or
Bomdi or Salvation spells will get rid of it.

Dark Matter is high almighty damage to all. He will use it at low HP or on
the turn after if you use a reflective spell or item like Attack Mirror or
Makarakarn, etc. He'll also use it every turn if you let him use Left Hand
all the way to +4, but that shouldn't really ever happen.

Basically buff up with Luster Candy or Rakukaja and debuff him with Tarunda
or Debilitate, then use physicals or Ice spells for Co-Ops. If he starts to
Drain the Ice spells later in the battle, just use whatever Physical or
Almighty or basically anything he doesn't Null/Drain to finish him off.
He shouldn't be too hard.

¯¯¯
Scene after the fight, then continue.

Go northwest and when you're as far west as you can go, try to walk out south
onto "nothingness" to reveal a hidden path which leads to [Bead x2] in a box.
Then continue back north. Yeah. A "new" dungeon element-- hidden paths.
Some of them give hints as to where you should walk, while some don't.

When you reach an apparent dead end in the center of the floor, try to walk
east in the middle of the platform for a hidden path. When you reach yet
another apparent dead end, go south. On this path you can go east, to another
dead end. Go south, then east, then south on the nothingness to reach a
platform with some stairs leading up to B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Search this small area of 4F to acquire rare Forma [Gumonji Mirror].
This can be taken back to the Lab to get the [Enemy Search C] Main App.
With it, you can now find even more types of Hidden enemies and Fiends.
Go back down to B5F.

- Horologium B5F

At the dead end before the one leading to the stairs, go north then
east to reveal more hidden paths. Then north, east, and north.
One tile west, turn north and you can reveal a hidden path leading to a box
with [Soma x2]. Back on the main path, head west, north, west, north, west.

Here at the dead end path that looks like the floor's entrance, go south,
then west, then north to reach stairs down.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way through this simple maze with the blocks that pop up as you
approach them. A portal is accessible in the southwest. Go through it.

Here, go west 2 tiles, south 3, east 1, then south onto the invisible walkway.

On it, go south, then west, then south. Go all the way south, and turn east
when you can. Go 4 tiles east from when you turned east, then turn north and
go north two. A Forma should appear on your map. Loop around to the north
side of the forma then go south to grab it. It's [Raven Stone] and will
turn into the [Visualizer C] Main App that lets you see in the yellow color
"Type C" dark areas. Go back to the hidden gate opened earlier, just past
the maze area where the red walls pop up.

From it, head one tile west, then north and you'll step into a hidden area.
It's a maze of sorts. Head north until you teleport. Now, you'll have to
nagigate an annoying teleporter maze here where all teleports lead to the
same area and you want to avoid them all.

The solution to it is, from the teleport's destination:

5 tiles west, 1 north, 1 west, 1 north, 2 west, 2 south, 1 east, 1 south,
1 east, 1 south, 1 east, 3 south, 2 west, 2 north, and go through the
elevator door. Take it down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleport here in this small area, and use it to reach the east
side of B9F. Ride the elevator here back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

From here, you can get to the marked spot from earlier and begin the Law
exclusive EX Mission by talking to the Cherub at that spot.
When the angels all merge into Seraph, accept his request.

• EX Mission: Evil's lingering shadow

Go all the way west and open the portal and go through it. Go two tiles
north and search east to find a portal, and go through it. Follow this path
to some stairs down to B7F.

- Horologium B7F

Follow the small path here through the door and hit the switch at the end of
the path. Go back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Ride the elevator back down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleporter in this small area back to the west side of B9F, and then
ride the elevator back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way, again, to the gate near where the maze with popping up red
walls is. From it, loop around to a D-type locked door to the south and
go through it. Another red walls popping up area here.

In the south is a terminal and heal spot. Look for a portal on the east
wall to the northeast, and go through it. Search for yet another portal
on the east wall in this new hallway, and go through.

To your east, you can find a box with [Megidola Stone x1]. To the far
south is an elevator down, while to the southwest, behind a D-type locked
door is a switch to get rid of the red walls that pop up. Hit the switch.

The elevator can be rode down to B7F which is useless for now as a portal
opens from the other side of the wall later, and to 1F where you can now open
up a shortcut to right near the beginning of Horologium. Do what you need then
find the stairs down next to the terminal here on B6F and go down.

- Horologium B7F

Open the door to the north and go through. Yeah, new type of area.
Invisible WALLS. This makes it annoying to navigate. Go north until you
hit a wall, then east until you hit a wall. South then west from here is
[Sacrifice x1] in a box. Now go back east, then north until you hit a wall.

From here, west until you reach a door on the north wall. Open it, go through
and hit the switch then go back into the room with invisible walls.
Work your way south and west and you'll hit a space manipulation device.
Time to go to other areas.

Phase Shift to type A. Work your way around in this area to the northwest
and go through the door. Follow this path until you reach a switch. Hit it.
Go back and Phase Shift B at the device. Work your way around the northeast
side of this room then go south to get [Great Chakra x1]. In the southeast
end, go through the door.

In the southeast end here, you can open up a shortcut to the elevator that
connects with B6F and 1F. To the north, a terminal and heal spot. Just west
of that terminal, a portal you can open to get [Bead of Life x1].

Go back and phase shift back to the original space, then in the room with
the space manipulation device, take the north exit. Here, go all the way
north and you'll find some stairs down. West of those stairs, a terminal
and heal spot. Use them if needed, then head down.

If you can't get past the rock in the middle of the hall to get to the stairs
it's because you didn't hit all of the switches on each side of the rock
(west, south, and east). You probably missed the east one, which is accessed
from stairs down in the northeast part of B6F.

- Horologium B8F

Literally head straight south and go down the stairs. You can deviate to
pickup some forma if you want, but this isn't a complicated floor.

- Horologium B9F

Explore the northwest to find [Sacrifice x1] and [Bead of Life x1].
Explore the northeast to find [Amrita Shower x2] and a terminal and
heal spot. This is the final save point. Do all of the EX Missions
and gear and forma grinding/level grinding/fusion you need to.

West of the terminal is a portal. Go through it. You are now in the area
of B9F you accessed earlier and met Gore in. Obviously, the big room there
houses Mem Aleph. Equip your Main Character with the Gibo Eyes Sub App if you
happen to have it, then go in when ready.

You will want to create a party of mixed alignments with powerful attack
and healing skills.

If you want some premade demons and are prepared to probably farm up a lot
of money, here is a full varied alignment team that will destroy the
final boss without much trouble.

< Boss: Mother Mem Aleph >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 7300 / MP: 9999 ]

> Nu: Gun, Expel, Curse <

This is the final boss.

She has hit-all elemental spells, Asura's "Asura Roga", Ouroboros' ailment
skill "Disaster Cycle", "Mother's Kiss" - a 6-8 hit physical skill, and
"Reason's Start" which removes all buffs and debuffs from both sides and then
heals her for around 600 HP. Great Flood, which does damage to all party
members and lowers your Agility battle statistic by -1.

This boss is serious. You need serious damage output and healing skills to
match it. Buff/debuff spells aren't so hot here because of Reason's Start.
You'll need to spam your demon's strongest spells.

Jihad is a highly recommended skill, though it comes only from very high level
demon's source. High tier elemental and/or almighty skills work too.

Make sure your MC is equipped with the best armor you have, preferably the
Dragon Vest from the Fafnir EX mission, and the accessory that will revive
you once per battle should you die, Dragon Ring. Keep your MC healthy.
At all times.

¯¯¯
When you win, another fight.

---

< Boss: Empty Mem Aleph >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 9000 / MP: 9999 ]
Six random sets of resists, changes each turn.

> Wk: Phys / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Elec, Wind <
> Wk: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Phys, Wind <
> Wk: Fire / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Phys, Gun <
> Wk: Ice / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Gun, Fire <
> Wk: Elec / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Fire, Ice <
> Wk: Wind / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Ice, Elec <

Same skills as last time, plus two more. One is named Mem Aleph, and it
will return all demons of a randomly chosen alignment to your stock.
This is why you need a varied team in alignment. Second is called simply MA,
and it will do an amount of damage equal to the target's current HP and heal
Mem Aleph by that amount. This is primarily why you wear the Dragon Ring.
It will save you from death from this once if you are the target of it.

The changing resists is why you equip the Gibo Eyes Sub App. It lets you see
what is ineffective and by proxy, what is effective.

This fight is exactly like the last one except for the addition of new
attacks on her part. She just has more HP. Use the same strategy and mind
the target cursor each turn for the resist changes.

If Mem Aleph or MA is used, revive/summon the demon back or better yet if
your demons have the Sabbatma or Invitation skills, use those to help get the
party back up and running. Don't be afraid to use some heavy restoration
items, but don't go crazy because they do carry over to a second cycle.

¯¯¯
After you win, that's it. The Law ending plays and you're given a choice
to save your game to play through again with bonuses while you keep many of
the things you've earned.

Walkthrough: Sector Horologium - Chaos Path [SJ_WALK-H_C]
/******************\*\*******************\_******************\*\*******************\
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

So you've chosen to side with the demons and their vision of a more primal
world as things supposedly used to be, with themselves, many of them old gods
at the helm. Gore doesn't like this and decides you must die.

---

< Boss: Meta Gore >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 15000 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Wind / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Phys, Gun <

Gore is a beast. Fortunately, he only uses Physical and Gun attacks.
He has a lot of HP, and is weak to wind.
A team that is Strong to Phys and/or Gun is good.
Here's his skill set...

Self-Denial -- Heals him for a few hundred HP and has the same effect as
a cast of Tarukaja to boot.

Charge -- Next physical does more than two times as much damage.

Heaven Strike -- Light, random, multiple hits of physical damage.

E.N.D. -- Random physical damage plus chance for Fear status ailment.

Adaptation -- Huge physical damage strike. Seems to only use it after using
Charge and will target the main character with it every time. If you are
not Strong to Phys and not guarding, you will die. I guarantee this.

"Gore is bursting with power!" -- happens automatically once in the fight
and heals him for 7500 HP as well as clearing any debuffs you've stacked
onto him.

Rain Strike -- Heavy, random target gun damage.

You'll want a team that can attack with elemental attacks--preferably Wind--
and has a good number of the same old, same old buffs and debuffs.
Luster Candy or Rakukaja on the buff side and Debilitate or Tarunda/War Cry or
Dekaja on the debuff side. You could try without them, but well, he hits very
hard if he isn't debuffed.

Main Character should be equipped with an armor that is Strong to Phys and
perhaps Gun -- "Armor Vest" armor is ideal as it is strong to both.
A gun that gives him a wind elemental attack is nice, too, if you're using
same-alignment demons to get Co-Op attacks.

Dekaja is needed to remove the attack buff from Gore's Self-Denial if you're
not using Debilitate, War Cry Tarunda to lower his attack as you probably
should be.

You'll need to use Elemental or Almighty attacks to damage him since he
reflects Phys and Gun. Wind + Co-Ops is nice but you'd probably have to make
a whole new custom team for exploiting that setup.

This is just a long fight. You should have plenty of Chakra Drops however,
and this is a good place to spend them. Gore will heal himself for 7500 HP
one or two times throughout this battle, and Gore himself has the highest
HP of any boss in the game save the ultimate optional boss.

¯¯¯
After the fight, scenes will play with Jimenez.
The main mission objectives of Horologium's Exotic Matter will be updated.
You will now need to go talk to Mem Aleph in B9F of Horologium.
You'll notice all of the crewmembers have kinda gone bonkers, too.
Save and heal up.

If you head into Grus now, you can talk to Grendel who will tell you go to
where Maya was. If you do, you will meet Mara. Mara will give you the Chaos
exclusive EX Mission. If you killed Grendel earlier, just go straigh to
where Maya was to meet Mara.

• EX Mission: Mara's desire

Get that if you wish, then head into Horologium.

- Horologium 1F

Head to the elevator and go down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Enter the room in the back and talk to Mem Aleph.
A new main mission will be added.

• Mission: Find the Four Cosmic Eggs

She will also give you the rare Forma [Clement Bell].
Leave Horologium after the scene.

Go to the Lab to have the Clement Bell turned into [Unlock D] Main App.

You will now need to go Antlia, Bootes, Carina, and Delphinus to progress.

First stop, Antlia.

- Antlia

On 1F, go to the north end of the floor and unlock the door that opens to your
new Unlock D function. Very straight-forward area. When you reach the C-type
dark areas (yellow), go through the middle door and look for the exit east,
along the south wall. Save at the terminal here, then search the wall to the
east for a portal and go through.

Wu Kong will be here and will simply give you [Cosmic Egg #1].
Leave Antlia and go to Bootes.

- Bootes

Take the elevators in the palace up to 6F. Open the door next to you with the
Unlock D function and ride the elevator beyond it up to 8F. Grab the
[Soma x2] to the south then go through the door here.
Take the door in the southeast of this big room, then go east to the terminal
and save. Go north of the terminal, and down the stairs.

Search just south of you for a portal, and go through. The missing ship, the
Gigantic is before you. Yatagarasu shows up and you'll have to fight it.

---

< Boss: Avian Yatagarasu x3 >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1000 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Gun, Ice / Nu: Expel, Curse / Dr: Fire <

You could probably win this one with auto-battle if it weren't for their
annoying "Ally Call" ability. All they'll do is boost their agility with
Sukukaja and then cast Maragidyne. Dekaja them if you find yourself missing
too much.

Spread your damage out on them equally and try to kill them within one to two
rounds of each other, otherwise the last one will use Ally Call and then two
more Yatagarasu with full health will show up. They have about 1000 HP
a piece, to gauge how much you should do to each one before firing off a nice
hit-all finisher.

¯¯¯¯
Winning gets you [Cosmic Egg #2]. Leave Bootes afterwards, and go to Carina.

- Carina

Go up to 2F and phase shift over to dimension B at the south device.
Work your way north and go through the door unlocked with the Unlock D App.
Save your game at the terminal here, then search for a portal south of the
terminal. Go through. You will meet Zhu Yin here.

He will give you [Cosmic Egg #3] without a fight, just like Wu Kong did.

You can leave Carina now, or you can explore the phase shift B areas on 2F
and 3F to pickup some items -- [Great Chakra x1], [Bead Chain x1],
[Bead of Life x1] and [Amrita Shower x2] and THEN leave Carina!

Enter Delphinus next.

- Delphinus 1F

On 1F, you can now open the locked door near Kudlak. More conveyors.
Ride the one of the west two to the north, then go east and search for a
portal. Go through and hit the switch, then go back out and ride the conveyor
to your north. Follow at the turn ahead, go straight south until you stop,
then go west and ride the westmost conveyor. When that conveyor stops, search
west for a portal and go through it.

Now ride the conveyor north, flip the switch to change the directions of the
conveyors back to normal, and ride the conveyor back south, going through
the secret door you just opened. Go south down the conveyor, then east past
the next conveyor, and after you turn going north, go onto the first conveyor
you reach. Go south when that conveyor stops.

You can now use an elevator and open up a short back to the beginning of the
floor south of the elevator. Take the elevator up to 9F.

- Delphinus 9F

Search for a portal to the southwest and go through it.
In this hallway, there are portals to the west. One going north and one south.
Through the south, [Great Chakra x1]. Through the north, a path to a terminal.
West of the terminal, search the south wall for a portal. Go through.

You will meet and have to fight Divine Cherub.

---

< Boss: Divine Cherub >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1200 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Elec / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Wind <

Another LOW hp "boss." Use Elec attacks for max efficiency with Co-Ops, or
just physical/gun attribute skills. You'll win in like 3 rounds tops.
He does know Megidola and Mahamaon, though by wearing most armors, the
Hama skills can't touch you.

¯¯¯
You get [Cosmic Egg #4]. Jimenez will comm you and tell you to go visit
Mem Aleph again. Leave Delphinus, and go back to Horologium.

- Horologium 1F

Equip yourself to be strong to or to null both Expel and Curse.
Go into Horologium and try to ride the elevator down to B9F.
Israfel will show up and destroy it, and you will then have to fight him.

---

< Boss: Herald Israfel >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 1500 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Fire / Nu: Ice, Expel, Curse <

He has very little HP as well. What's with these easy bosses? You can take
Israfel out with physicals or Fire or whatever you want. He has only about
1500 HP. The problem is that he uses Horn of Fate and that can instantly
kill you if you aren't protected against Expel and Curse.

Aside from this, he also knows Luster Candy and Diarahan, so make sure that
your damage output isn't weak or you may have trouble killing him as he just
heals himself up to full over and over.

¯¯¯
You'll get the [Destiny Jewel] rare Forma after the battle. Take it back to
the Red Sprite's Lab to get the [Gate Search D] function. Now head back into
Horologium.

Take the door east of the entrance, and search for a portal in this hall.
Through it is a dark area. Go west as far as you can, north as far as you can
then south as far as you can, then east two tiles and north two tiles. Go
through the door.

Here, take the portal in the far west to get into a new dark area. In this
one, go north all the way, east all the way, north all the way, east all the
way, then through the door. Ride the elevator here.

B1F has a terminal past some annoying ailment/damage fields, but for now is
also a dead end.
B4F has a heal point and some damage/ailment fields, but for now is also a
dead end.
Go down to B2F to continue.

- Horologium B2F

Search for an obvious portal to get things going here. It's a linear area.
No real puzzling things must be done to traverse it. Go west until you reach
an elevator and ride it down to B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Go south into the poison fields, then east, and when you get to the fork,
go south. In the damage tiles, go east until you reach a door and go through
to get [Summon Stone x1]. Then back in the damage tile patch, go all the way
west and search for a portal and go through it. Now the path is clear to get
to an elevator. Go up to 1F.

- Horologium 1F

Search the wall to the southeast to open up a shortcut to the very entrance
of Horologium. Ignore the stairs as there's only access to an EX Mission
from Barong by traversing all of the C-type dark areas down there, and you
can't see in C-type dark areas yet.

Go back into the elevator and down to B3F.

- Horologium B3F

Go east and open the portal on the wall. Go east until you reach a fork, then
turn and go up the northwest path. Near the end of this path, search the south
wall to find a portal. Open it up and go through to get [30000 Macca] and
[Bead Chain x1]. Leave the room via the only door. Now go back to the central
part of this floor, and take the south path this time. You will reach a
Heal Spot and terminal. if you search the west wall 3 tiles above the terminal
you can find a portal. Go through it and get [Soma x2] and [Great Chakra x1].

Go east of the terminal and up the stairs.

- Horologium B2F

Annoying, annoying floor full of conveyors. Take them in the following order
if you want [Chakra Pot x1]:

Southmost, west, east, northwest, west, north, east, east, east, then east
four tiles south of where that conveyors ends up. Go north 3 tiles of where
this one ends up, then go east to the wall. Go south two tiles, then east to
and ride the next conveyor. Go south three tiles, then east to the wall, south
to the wall, west one tile, then south onto the conveyor. When this one stops,
go two tiles west then step onto the conveyor. Now, go east to the wall, then
south onto the conveyor. When this one stops, avoid all conveyors and find
your way to a treasure box. You will get the Chakra Pot. You can ride the
next conveyor to get back to the start of the floor.

Take them in the following order to take a pitfall back to an area of B3F you
can't access elsewhere and get [50000 Macca] from:

Southmost, west, east, northwest, west, north, east, east, east, then east
four tiles south of where that conveyors ends up. Go north 3 tiles of where
this one ends up, then go east to the wall. Go south two tiles, then east to
and ride the next conveyor. Go north and ride the conveyor. When it stops,
search north for a portal and go through. In here, search the west wall for a
portal and go through it. You will ride a conveyor into a pitfall to B3F.

In the west path here in this room, you can find a box at the end with the
promised 50000 Macca. The south path from that room leads back to a portal
which will open right near the terminal on B3F and therefore the stairs back
up to B2F.

Take them in this order to proceed in the dungeon:

Southmost, west, east, northwest, west, north, east, east, east, then east
four tiles south of where that conveyors ends up. Go north 3 tiles of where
this one ends up, then go east to the wall. Go south two tiles, then east to
and ride the next conveyor. Go south three tiles, then east to the wall, south
to the wall, west one tile, then south onto the conveyor. From here, go west
and ride the west conveyor. You can now access a terminal and stairs up to
B1F.

- Horologium B1F

Very small area. Just loop around and take the stairs down to B2F.

- Horologium B2F

Literally all you can do in this 1 tile area is take the stairs down.

- Horologium B3F

A very linear pathway. You can find a terminal and a heal spot near the
stairs leading down to B4F. Go down.

- Horologium B4F

Head past the D-type locked door, and go east in the hallway there.
Go through the one-way door on the north wall.
This is a big room with 6 doors, 3 on the east, 3 on the west.
Loiter around the northwest-most door until the Moon Phase reads 7/8 and is
about to turn Full. Go inside, and two tiles west to teleport.
If the moon phase is NOT full yet, go north one til, south one tile until it
is full. When it hits full, go south all the way to teleport elsewhere.

In this room, unlock and go through both the east and west doors.
Go through the west door to continue. You will come across a set of three
doors here. Go through the middle one, then down the small hallway past it
to teleport again.

Go directly east and search for a portal. This will unlock a shortcut to this
area, and you can find a terminal and Heal Spot beyond. Save, heal, then go
back west. You can find in this area [Balm of Rising x2], an elevator, and
stairs down.

Use the elevator which leads to 1F. On 1F, you can unlock yet another shortcut
to Horologium's very entrance. Go back down. Save and heal, and get ready for
a boss battle. The best armor to wear is the "Life Vest" which is Strong
against Wind while weak to Ice. The next boss uses Expel and Wind attacks.
Have demons with the standard setup of buffs/debuff like Luster Candy,
Debilitate etc. as well as good physicals or Fire attacks if you can get them
as well, then go down the stairs to B5F.

Here's some demons if you need them, of course.

- Horologium B5F

Attempt to go forward and a scene will trigger with Mastema. He's kinda pissed
at you, but for different reasons than you'd think an angel would be.
You have to fight him.

---

< Boss: Herald Mastema >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 8500 / MP: 9999 ]

> Wk: Fire / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Gun, Ice, Wind <

Mastema attacks with Wind, Expel, Almighty, and charm attacks primarily.

Great Lament attempts to charm every party member.

Judgement attempts to Expel instant-kill all party members.

Untainted Wind does Wind damage to all party members.

Mel Faize does almighty damage to all party members.

In addition, he has a regular attack that hits all party members.

He's a big pushover should you use the conventional buff up with Luster Candy
and debuff him with Tarunda or Debilitate method and then chop away with
physicals or Fire attacks+Co-Ops. Again, do not go above the magical +3/-3
buff/debuff sweet spot because of Dekaja/Dekunda.

The only thing you need to watch out for if using the buff method to defeat
Mastema is early in the fight that Great Lament may charm your party members.
Remedy this with Dis-Charm or Salvation spell from your demon(s).

Honestly this guy is so, so easy compared to who you fight here on the
Law and Neutral paths. He's all talk.

¯¯¯
• Herald Mastema fusion is unlocked.

Enjoy the fan-servicey scene between Mastema and everyone's favorite fallen
angel, you-know-who. Then continue on.

Go northwest and when you're as far west as you can go, try to walk out south
onto "nothingness" to reveal a hidden path which leads to [Bead x2] in a box.
Then continue back north. Yeah. A "new" dungeon element-- hidden paths.
Some of them give hints as to where you should walk, while some don't.

When you reach an apparent dead end in the center of the floor, try to walk
east in the middle of the platform for a hidden path. When you reach yet
another apparent dead end, go south. On this path you can go east, to another
dead end. Go south, then east, then south on the nothingness to reach a
platform with some stairs leading up to B4F.

- Horologium B4F

Search this small area of 4F to acquire rare Forma [Gumonji Mirror].
This can be taken back to the Lab to get the [Enemy Search C] Main App.
With it, you can now find even more types of Hidden enemies and Fiends.
Go back down to B5F.

- Horologium B5F

At the dead end before the one leading to the stairs, go north then
east to reveal more hidden paths. Then north, east, and north.
One tile west, turn north and you can reveal a hidden path leading to a box
with [Soma x2]. Back on the main path, head west, north, west, north, west.

Here at the dead end path that looks like the floor's entrance, go south,
then west, then north to reach stairs down.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way through this simple maze with the blocks that pop up as you
approach them. A portal is accessible in the southwest. Go through it.

Here, go west 2 tiles, south 3, east 1, then south onto the invisible walkway.

On it, go south, then west, then south. Go all the way south, and turn east
when you can. Go 4 tiles east from when you turned east, then turn north and
go north two. A Forma should appear on your map. Loop around to the north
side of the forma then go south to grab it. It's [Raven Stone] and will
turn into the [Visualizer C] Main App that lets you see in the yellow color
"Type C" dark areas. Go back to the hidden gate opened earlier, just past
the maze area where the red walls pop up.

From it, head one tile west, then north and you'll step into a hidden area.
It's a maze of sorts. Head north until you teleport. Now, you'll have to
nagigate an annoying teleporter maze here where all teleports lead to the
same area and you want to avoid them all.

The solution to it is, from the teleport's destination:

5 tiles west, 1 north, 1 west, 1 north, 2 west, 2 south, 1 east, 1 south,
1 east, 1 south, 1 east, 3 south, 2 west, 2 north, and go through the
elevator door. Take it down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleport here in this small area, and use it to reach the east
side of B9F. Ride the elevator here back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

If you have the Mara's desire EX Mission, you can find the marked spot
in this area. However it may be a good idea to confront Seraph after you
open the rest of 6F later on after you press the switch to get rid of the
Magma and access the terminal/heal spot. Anyway, to continue...

Go all the way west and open the portal and go through it. Go two tiles
north and search east to find a portal, and go through it. Follow this path
to some stairs down to B7F.

- Horologium B7F

Follow the small path here through the door and hit the switch at the end of
the path. Go back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Ride the elevator back down to B9F.

- Horologium B9F

Find the teleporter in this small area back to the west side of B9F, and then
ride the elevator back up to B6F.

- Horologium B6F

Make your way, again, to the gate near where the maze with popping up red
walls is. From it, loop around to a D-type locked door to the south and
go through it. Another red walls popping up area here.

In the south is a terminal and heal spot. Look for a portal on the east
wall to the northeast, and go through it. Search for yet another portal
on the east wall in this new hallway, and go through.

To your east, you can find a box with [Megidola Stone x1]. To the far
south is an elevator down, while to the southwest, behind a D-type locked
door is a switch to get rid of the red walls that pop up. Hit the switch.

The elevator can be rode down to B7F which is useless for now as a portal
opens from the other side of the wall later, and to 1F where you can now open
up a shortcut to right near the beginning of Horologium. Do what you need then
find the stairs down next to the terminal here on B6F and go down.

- Horologium B7F

Open the door to the north and go through. Yeah, new type of area.
Invisible WALLS. This makes it annoying to navigate. Go north until you
hit a wall, then east until you hit a wall. South then west from here is
[Sacrifice x1] in a box. Now go back east, then north until you hit a wall.

From here, west until you reach a door on the north wall. Open it, go through
and hit the switch then go back into the room with invisible walls.
Work your way south and west and you'll hit a space manipulation device.
Time to go to other areas.

Phase Shift to type A. Work your way around in this area to the northwest
and go through the door. Follow this path until you reach a switch. Hit it.
Go back and Phase Shift B at the device. Work your way around the northeast
side of this room then go south to get [Great Chakra x1]. In the southeast
end, go through the door.

In the southeast end here, you can open up a shortcut to the elevator that
connects with B6F and 1F. To the north, a terminal and heal spot. Just west
of that terminal, a portal you can open to get [Bead of Life x1].

Go back and phase shift back to the original space, then in the room with
the space manipulation device, take the north exit. Here, go all the way
north and you'll find some stairs down. West of those stairs, a terminal
and heal spot. Use them if needed, then head down.

If you can't get past the rock in the middle of the hall to get to the stairs
it's because you didn't hit all of the switches on each side of the rock
(west, south, and east). You probably missed the east one, which is accessed
from stairs down in the northeast part of B6F.

- Horologium B8F

Literally head straight south and go down the stairs. You can deviate to
pickup some forma if you want, but this isn't a complicated floor.

- Horologium B9F

Explore the northwest to find [Sacrifice x1] and [Bead of Life x1].
Explore the northeast to find [Amrita Shower x2] and a terminal and
heal spot. This is the final save point of Horologium, but you won't
have to fight the final boss here.

West of the terminal is a portal. Go through it. You are now in the area
of B9F you accessed earlier and met Gore in. Obviously, the big room there
houses Mem Aleph. Go inside and talk to her.

The main mission Find the Four Cosmic Eggs is now complete.
Mem Aleph will give you [EM: Horologium] and a new main mission will be
added...

• Mission: Reach the Vanishing Point

The next thing to do is leave Horologium and head for Eridanus.

- Eridanus

I'm sure you know where you need to go. Head up to the TOP floor and
save your game. Equip an armor that is not weak to Expel or Curse.
Preferably the very powerful Dragon Vest or Mesotes Vests, neither of which
have a weakness and both of which are very high Def power. In addition, equip
the main character with the "Dragon Ring" accessory.

If you want some premade demons and are prepared to probably farm up a lot
of money, here is a full Chaos team that will destroy the final boss without
much trouble, using Phys attacks.

Head into the Vanishing Point room where you fought Ouroboros much earlier
in the game, and the main mission Reach the Vanishing Point concludes.
However, you will have someone to fight.

< Boss: Pillar Zelenin >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 10000 / MP: 9999 ]

> St: Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Elec <

Zelenin is the final boss of the Chaos path.

Her attacks are as follows:

Wave of Death -- a powerful hit-all Physical attack.

Megido Storm -- a powerful hit-all Elec spell.

Right Hand -- Basically Luster Candy. Counter with Dekaja or offset with
Debilitate or Jihad.

Requiem -- Instant kill that can pierce both Tetraja AND Expel and Curse
null, but won't have a high chance of hitting if buff/debuffs are properly
done. Targets all party members.

Sinner's Song -- almighty damage plus possible charm to all.

Plus her regular attack hits all, as well.

Much like many previous bosses, you'll want to buff up here to begin,
preferably with Luster Candy and then debuff Zelenin with what you can --
preferably with either Debilitate or by using the endgame attack skill
Jihad which basically huge almighty damage + Debilitate in one.
Again, try not to go above +3/-3 buff status. Though with Jihad, you
really can't help it on the debuff side but don't worry as you'll
simply reapply those stat debuffs while using it on her.

With buffs/debuffs up, Zelenin is very managable and you should only
have trouble when she uses Requiem or Sinner's Song, both of which
will have very low success rates in killing or charming you when the buffs
and debuffs are active. The most important debuff in this fight is to her
agility, rather than to her attack power. But Debilitate and Jihad have all
debuffs in one, so why not use them if you've got them?

Attack her using Physical, Almighty or anything other than Elec.
After using Requiem, she becomes weak to Physical for several rounds.
That's when you can spam Co-Ops on her for extra damage via physicals, or
just bust out with high end physical skills.

The Dragon Ring will save you from Requiem once should it hit you, though
it has a very low chance to assuming you've buffed up and debuffed properly.

Be high 70s or higher with demons of similar levels and this fight should not
really be a problem for you to win.

¯¯¯
After you win, that's it. The Chaos ending plays and you're given a choice
to save your game to play through again with bonuses while you keep many of
the things you've earned.

- Grus 1F

This section is for New Game+/ second cycle players only. On your first play,
an angel says "This is not the time to open this to man, God will tell me
when it is" or some such. This is basically navigational directions to get
through the whole second half of Grus accessible from Phase Shift Sanctum A
only on a New Game+/second cycle.

First you'll need to do "Marebito, the foreign god" EX Mission for the
Gate Search E Main App. With the Gate Search E Main App, you need to have
gotten the [Cornucopia] rare Forma discussed earlier in the first Grus section
of the walkthrough-- it's in Grus 1F original, non-phase shifted area if you
do not have it. Look for a gate search portal in the northwest part of that
floor near the Strike Team corpse.

Cornucopia becomes the Unlock E Main App. With the Unlock E Main App, you can
now go to that door in Grus Phase Shift A, which leads to the east side of
Grus B1F via some stairs going down. You'll pickup a new EX Mission doing
that as well from the suspicious Strike Team member in front of the previously
impassable door.

• EX Mission: The mother goddess' gravestone

Beyond the door you will find stairs down to B1F. The "Red Carpet" Sub App
is a real big help since this is just a nightmare to navigate and having 0
random encounters will save you a headache when navigating this mess.

- Grus B1F

This is a small area with no real branching paths. Head down the stairs to
the east of where you entered.

- Grus B2F

Another area, this time you'll find a terminal in the center and two stairs
to take. The northwest stairs leads up to B1F where you can grab
[Sacrifice x1] and pitfall back down into the area you were just in.
Take the southeast stairs afterwards back up to B1F.

- Grus B1F

Its teleports or pitfalls depending on which path you take here. Take the
east one to begin, as the rest are pitfalls to previously visited places.
Now take the south path. Then the west. Follow the small path around
in here to teleport--there's no option on where to go. Move forward again
to teleport, as you are on another small path.

You'll now be in a larger area with actual choices. In it, at the fork
here, turn north and go straight north as far as you can to teleport.
Another four way area, three pits and one teleport. Head north in it to
teleport! Once at the destination, head east to teleport.
All you'll be able to do now is navigate this small area until you fall
down a pitfall to B2F.

- Grus B2F

Another large yet devoid of much area. There's a terminal, and northeast of
it, stairs up. Go up.

- Grus B1F

Go north at the fork here, as the south will just cause a need for back
tracking, and you don't want that. At the north side of these hallways,
you will find a teleport. After the teleport, you're in more 4-way areas
with only one teleporter and 3 pits. Go south to teleport.
From here, take the west teleport. Now, take the north one.
Loop around in this small area to teleport.

Here, go straight north until you hit a teleport. Go east until you
teleport now. You'll only be able to follow a small path into a pitfall
from here.

- Grus B2F

All you'll find here is stairs. But first, unlock the hidden gate portal to
the southeast of those stairs, then go down them.

- Grus B3F

One way doors. Joy. This one's more annoying though, you have to use the
phase shift and screwing up means huge amounts of backtracking to get back
and try again.

First, let's get a treasure! Go west two doors, south one, east three, then
north one. Grab the box with [Sacrifice x1], then go west a door.
You are back at the entrance again.

From the start here, go west three doors. Use the phase shifter and shift
over to Sanctum A. Go one door south, and search the east wall here for a
secret door. Go through, and from here, go east, east, south, west, south.
Search for a secret portal on the east and open it up for later, then
go west, then north. Take the stairs up.

- Grus B2F

Nothing to do but go up the stairs to the north here.

- Grus B1F

Straight north of this entrance to B1F, you can find stairs up. To the
east and west of those stairs are doors with small rooms containing these
items: [Summon Stone x1] and [Great Chakra x1].

South of the stairs going back down that you came from (avoid trying to go
into 1 tile corridors to the east, west and far south as they are pitfalls and
backtracking sucks and all that) you can find, along the east and west walls,
secret portals to small rooms that contain items. You need Gate Search D
to open these however, so if you come here early before Horologium you kinda
can't get these items. They are: [Lu Incense x1] and [Amrita Soda x2].

You'll want go up the stairs in the north up to 1F when you've got your items
from these boxes.

- Grus 1F

Save and heal here before you even think of going into the room to your
south. A Strike Team member gives a sort of friendly reminder if you step
up to the door. It looks a lot like Maya's room's entrance, doesn't it?
Well, there's a reason why. Behind the door...

< Boss: Geist Alilat >
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[ HP: 3500 / MP: 9999 ]

> St: Phys / Nu: Gun, Expel, Curse <

One of the optional New Game+ bosses. Only elemental and almighty are going to
do you any good here against Alilat. Alilat herself only has four actions.
A regular attack, Megidolaon, Concentrate, and Diarahan. Yes, Diarahan.
A full freaking heal. She only has about 3500 HP, though.

You'll want to begin the fight concentrating on buffs and debuffs.
Luster Candy and Debilitate or Jihad or other real powerful spells.
The Megidolaon may hurt so I recommend spamming Mediarahan or Salvation
with one demon pretty much every round, or using a Bead Chain if you end a
round with too little HP.

At +3/-3 buff status, the Megidolaon shouldn't hurt too much unless Alilat
uses Concentrate, in which case you may want to guard if your HPs aren't
dangerously low and you'd need to prioritize healing.

The way to win this fight is basically to slam her with very high level demons
with Jihad, Big Bang, Megidolaon or Element + Amp spells. There really isn't
much strategy involved. If you've got high enough level demons with Jihad, you
can probably end this fight in a couple rounds of spamming it.
You'll certainly need such demons for the next EX Mission.

¯¯¯
• Geist Alilat fusion is unlocked.

You'll be treated to a scene afterwards where the EX Mission "The mother
goddess' gravestone" concludes and be given the rare Forma [Nabatea Stone].
If you agree to help what appears to be Metatron afterwards, you'll get
yet another new EX Mission.

• EX Mission: False god in chains

Whew. Well, it's time to get cracking on working our way down to B4F of this
dungeon. That means going back down through the floors...
Start by heading down to B1F from the stairs here.

- Grus B1F

Go east of the stairs down to B2F which are to the south to fall down a pit.

- Grus B2F

Hey! You know where you are. Right next to the stairs down to B3F.
That's good. Go down them.

- Grus B3F

Go west three doors and phase shift over to Sanctum B. All you can do now
is go west and up the stairs.

- Grus B2F

Now a boring part. You need to do some backtracking. Open up the portal here
in this small room, then go up the stairs to the southwest. From here,
you'll have to tread already covered area by stepping on teleports and falling
down pits to get to the northeast stairs down to B3F once again.
You've already covered this ground, so I shouldn't need to explain how to do
it once again. Just follow the teleporters. Once you get to those stairs,
go down them.

- Grus B3F

Yeah, all that backtracking just to get back over to this side... annoying.
Time to go through some one-way doors in a specific order.

Take doors in the following order: West, west, south, west, west, south,
east, south. Search the east wall to open a secret portal, and go through it.
From here, take the doors north, east, north, north, west, west.
You'll be at the space manipulation device again. Set it to the original
space now. Go west through the door, and up the stairs.

- Grus B2F

More annoying backtracking... but this time things have to be done differently
in order to reach a new destination. Go out the door and take the stairs up
to B1F.

- Grus B1F

Yeah, you'll have to take more teleports back to traversed areas.
But you'll need to drop down a specific pit this time. Anyway, from this
location, go north until you teleport. Go north again and teleport.
Go east and teleport. Loop around and drop down the pit.

- Grus B2F

Go up the stairs beyond the terminal.

- Grus B1F

Take the teleport to the north. At the teleport destination, go south to
teleport. Now go west to teleport. From here, fall down the pit to either the
south or the east.

- Grus B2F

Almost done getting to B4F here... from here, you can access stairs down.
First, though, unlock the hidden portal to the southeast of those stairs.
Now go down the stairs.

- Grus B3F

This is the southeast B3F east entrance. Due to the unlocked secret portals
from before, it is now possible to progress on this floor. Go west three
doors, north one, then west two. Consider this spot right here a hub.
It has a phase shifter, but to get to the next boss via the elevator you do
not need to use it.

From here, if you go north one door you can access the elevator. Take it
down... if you dare!... Ok, you won't be in imminent danger just from going
down. If you want to go down, go ahead. You won't be able to do anything down
there except save/heal unless you have the Enemy Search C Main App.

If you want treasure, well, that's different story. First, I hope you like
a lot of backtracking. You know what I told you to consider a hub above?
Well, from it, set the Phase Shift to A. Now, go south, grab the
[Vi Incense x1], go east and up the stairs.

On B2F, find the hidden portal to the west and go through it. Here's the
cool fun part. Backtrack your way to the southeast entrance to B3F.
Nope, not kidding. Have fun. There yet? Good. From it, go west three doors,
north one, west one. Grab the [Megidola Stone x1] here. Now all you can
do is go south and up the stairs.

If you wish to get back down to B4F's elevator, well, first you need to
backtrack to the northeast entrance to B3F and reset the phase shifter back
to the original, then you need to backtrack to the southeast entrance to B3F
and you can finally make your way back to that elevator. Was that treasure
really worth it? Probably not.

That's when you can continue to the end of this crazy bonus dungeon by going
down the elevator.

- Grus B4F

Just ahead you can find a terminal and heal spot. To do what you need to do
down here (fight the big badass and complete the EX Mission) you require the
Enemy Search C App from Horologium. If you don't have it yet, leave since
you can't do anything here. If you do have it however, go north past the
terminal and heal spot and in the northmost room, choose to scan when the
game prompts you to.

Actually, don't. Not without being prepared. Really prepared. How prepared?
Level 99 prepared. With very good demons. These are mine. They're, well,
really expensive. If you max out the analyze gauge on your own
versions of these first, you can save yourself some serious dough.

¯¯¯
In addition, the Solomon Ring accessory is a good choice, along with
the Absolute Vest armor and the Peacemaker, Megido Fire or Meteor Dragoon
guns. You will also need a number of quality restorative items.
Bead Chains, Great Chakras, Beads of Life. Yeah, you should have enough
to get you through this fight unless you played the game really underleveled
twice and spent them on scraping by bosses. You won't need too many if you
use my custom demons, as they have a beastly high Ma stat.

Who is this ultimate boss? The one thought to be the creator god of our world
in gnosticism. Known by names such as as Ialdabaoth, or "the demiurge".
Go on in and scan to begin the fight.

Yes... serious business here. Very serious business indeed.

Demiurge is by far the strongest boss in the game. This is why I suggest the
powerful demons, level 99 and good equipment for an easy time. You can only
reliably damage him with Almighty attacks. He effectively reflects and nulls
all of the rest of them regularly to the point where you'd have to build a
team that covers all elements on most demons for any kind of efficiency
approaching just spamming the same one or two Almighty attacks.
Sad, but true.

The strategy is basically to buff up with Luster Candy to +3 and spam
Jihad, while using restoratives on your main character. Begin by using a
Tetraja Stone on your main character to prevent any instant-kills via
Mahamaon or Mamudoon and if he uses one of those spells, use another Tetraja
Stone. In any case, your main character isn't going to cause any kind of
significant damage here unless you did the Mysterious device to farm
Incense via the boss rush to up him to 99 all stats or something.
That isn't needed, though.

As an alternative to Jihad you could also Debilitate him to -3 and then
use Big Bang or other almighty skills like Babylon Goblet, Megidolaon, etc.
Big Bang only costs 10 less MP than Jihad and the only benefit you'll
see is that he deals less damage to you on the turns that he does attack
due to the constant -3 to his attack.

Even if you did max your MC's stats out, he can't compare to Jihad-using 90+
Ma demons. Use him to throw items to heal the party and replenish party MP.

Demiurge will spend many of his turns using Dekunda with the Jihad strategy,
to remove Jihad's debuffs. He'll spend a few using Diarama which heals him
for 900-1200, and your damage output with my password demons will be insane,
should you choose to use them. You should only need 1 or 2 Great Chakras or
Beads of Life to beat him into submission if you use those demons.

If using lesser demons with 60s, 70s or otherwise below 80 Ma, it will take
you much longer to defeat him. Much, much longer. And you'll need more items
to heal with, too. Anyway, spam him down with almighty and items, that's
basically all there is to it. The hardest part is of course getting a party
capable of doing it. A decent amount of grinding is needed. Nowhere near as
much as say, Digital Devil Saga ultimate bosses, but still quite a bit.

His attacks include Big Bang, Mamudoon, Mahamaon, Agi Gate, Bufu Gate,
Zio Gate, Garu Gate, Luster Candy, Dekunda, and that Disaster Cycle attack
that was first seen on Ouroboros and then reused on a few other bosses.
But really, you'll probably never even see half of them if you're Jihad
spamming him.

Killing time I
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Dent at the Red Sprite's Deck after you have
reached Bootes or later in story-progression.

How to complete : The objective is to not be the one who counts to 30.
Try to get the numbers 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25 and force
Dent to pick 30 by being the one who selects 29.

Reward : 1000 Macca. He won't play you again after you win.

Killing time II
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Dent at the Red Sprite's Deck after you enter
Delphinus and have completed the Killing time I EX Mission.

How to complete : You'll have to play a game with Dent. It's a game of chance
where you want to be the first to get 10 rocks. You can play
Add a rock, Counter, and Take two rocks. Countering Take two
rocks adds two of the other guy's rocks to yours, while
Add a rock cannot be countered. This isn't hard to win.
It's just a simple game of chance.

Reward : 2500 Macca. You can play him again as well but he won't
give you anymore money if you win again.

Black box retrieval I
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Dent in the Deck and ask him if there's anything you
can help with. He'll introduce you to Gekko who asks you to
find the Black Boxes of the DEMONICA suits of dead Strike
Team members in each sector. This becomes available after
entering Carina.

How to complete : You need to find the black boxes in sectors A-D.

                  In Antlia, the corpse is in the east part of B2F accessible
                  from southeast B1F.
                  In Bootes, the corpse is in eastern 7F.
                  In Carina, the corpse is in a small hallway just southeast
                  of the entrance to the sector on 1F.
                  In Delphinus, the corpse is in a small room with a treasure
                  box on 2F, accessible via the conveyors.

                  When you have them all, take them back and talk to Dent.

Reward : Gibo Eyes Sub App. Shows you ineffective attacks with an "X"
on your target cursor in battle, even if you don't have the
enemy analyzed.

Black box retrieval II
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Dent at the Deck after completing the Black box
retrieval I EX Mission. You'll again talk to Gekko.

How to complete : You have to collect the Black Boxes from the corpses in
sectors E-H for this one.

                  In Eridanus, the corpse is just outside the teleport maze
                  on 1F.
                  In Fornax, the corpse is in eastern B2F. You do not need
                  to go into any dark areas to get at it.
                  In Grus, the corpse is in western 1F, non-phase shifted
                  area. It's easy to find.
                  In Horologium, the corpse is in northern B2F. You will
                  easily find it when exploring the dungeon normally.

                  Take them back to talk to Dent after collecting them.

Reward : Copernicus Sub App. Raises the odds of fusion accidents
to 100%. Useful for fusing the Zealot clan demons.

The enchanting spirit
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Dent in the Deck and ask him if you can help
out with anything to be introduced to Anthony.
This becomes available after entering Delphinus.

She can be found in Bootes 1F, outside the palace.
Simply talk to her in a random battle, then report back
to Dent.

Reward : Ma Incense x2

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Dent in the Deck at the Red Sprite. Again, ask if you can
help out again and talk to Anthony. Must have completed

Where : Dent at the Red Sprite. Ask to help out and, yes, talk to
good old Anthony. Must have completed the "Dream lover"

How to complete : The clues point to Skogsra, who can be found on the upper
floors of Delphinus. Talk to Skogsra during a random battle.
Now report back.

Reward : St Incense x2

The camel-mounted noblewoman
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Yeah, again from Dent at the Red Sprite. Again, ask to help.
Anthony again. Does this man ever give up? Obviously, must
have completed the "Waving her back goodbye" EX Mission
before you can get this one.

How to complete : The demon you're looking for is Gemori. She can be found
in B1F and B2F of Grus. Talk to her in a random battle.
Now report back to Dent.

Reward : Lu Incense x2 and Gemori's Note
Gemori's Note is a key item that contains a demon password.

                  ELELOHIMELOHOELO
                  HIMSEBAOTH-AMEN

                  Which is for a level 63 Fallen Gemori with the skills
                  Lullaby / Me Patra / Laplace Curse.

Lurker in the toilets
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Dent in the Deck after completing Bootes and ask
if there's anything you can help with. You'll be introduced
to Mia who wants this request fulfilled, something about a
"God of the toilets..."

How to complete : You'll have to fight an Enigma Kanbari. He's weak to
Physical attacks. This one is stronger than the ones you
can find with Enemy Search in the Carina sector, but
still not very difficult.

Reward : Secret Records, a rare Forma that turns into the
Enigma Converter Sub App, which allows you to fuse
Enigma clan demons.

The mecha-dragon's secret
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Dent at the Red Sprite's Deck late in the game
once Horologium opens, and ask if you can help out.
He'll introduce you to Tanaka, who asks you to get a part
of the mechanical dragon, Fafnir.

How to complete : Find Fafnir in a random battle in Horologium. The dark
areas in 1F definitely have a chance to encounter him.
You can also find him in the phase shift B area in B7F.

                  Talk to him during the encounter. You must answer in the
                  following ways:

                  • 1 -> That's right.
                  • 2 -> Give me part of your body.
                  • 3 -> Mere curiosity.

                  Now he'll ask you which part you want. You can't have them
                  all! You have to pick one.

                  You can choose the Screw, Scale, or Circuit. Each of them
                  gives a different reward. In my opinion, the Scale gives the
                  best reward. The others are made from more easily-gathered
                  materials, of course. Dragon Vest requires Onogoro Stone,
                  which is pretty rare.

                  Bring the item back to the Red Sprite afterwards and give
                  it to Tanaka via Dent.

Reward : Dragon Screw : Dragon Fang. (Sword)
Dragon Scale : Dragon Vest. (Armor)
Dragon Circuit : Dragon Ring. (Accessory)

[ HP: 600 / MP: 9999 ] > Nu: Expel, Curse <

                  He comes with 2 Wilder Nue demons of his own. Not a very
                  difficult fight, to be honest. Just take out his demons
                  and then take out McClane.

                  ¯¯¯

How to complete : The clue points to Poltergeist, who can be found in B1F of
Antlia. Talk to it during a random encounter.

Reward : Odin Passage. (Key Item)

The wise man's library II
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Thoth at the entrance of Eridanus.

her in a random encounter.

Reward : Thor Passage. (Key Item)

The wise man's library IV
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Thoth at Eridanus' entrance.

How to complete : The clue points to Melchom, who is in B1F of Antlia.
However, you need to do something special. You need to
negotiate with him as normal, and then when he asks what
you want, say nothing.

Reward : Frey Passage. (Key Item)

The wise man's library V
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Thoth again, at Eridanus' entrance.

How to complete : A two-part riddle. First, talk to Vivian at Eridanus TOP.
She appears in random encounters there. Next, talk to Surt
in a random encounter in Horologium B6F.

Reward : Moon Passage (Key Item) and Divine Sword. (Neutral only)
Also, if you look at all of the passages you can piece
together this demon password:

                  SUNMONTUESWEDNES
                  THURSFRISATURDAY

                  This is for a level 83 Vile Seth that has these skills:

                  Agidyne / Bufudyne / Ziodyne / Garudyne / Concentrate

Marebito, the foreign god
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Ame no Uzume on 2F of Eridanus to get this one.
She's in the southeast shortcut to the central heal spot/
terminal area on 2F.

How to complete : She requires you to find Amaterasu. To do this, you must
first be able to access sector Fornax. In Fornax, look
for Futotama in the field in the southwest ara. He will give
you an item, Tamashiro Mirror.

                  Take that item back to Ame no Uzume in Eridanus, and then
                  from there northwest of Ame no Uzume's location, look for a
                  gate portal that requires Gate Search C to open up. Through
                  that door, talk to the robed figure who you can find with
                  enemy search.

                  It looks like Kinmamon, but if you use the Tamashiro Mirror
                  when prompted, it's Amaterasu. Mission complete.

Reward : Rare Forma Sound Jewel, which becomes the optional
Gate Search E Main App.

The ever-steeper trial I
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : 3F of Eridanus, behind the west portal unlocked with Gate
Search B. Talk to Zouchouten here and agree to his terms.
Which are, of course, you cannot enter the battle with
any demons that have healing or revival skills.

How to complete : Fight and defeat Zouchouten under these rules. Not hard.

                  regular attack. You can't have demons with healing skills,
                  but you can still use healing items if you need.
                  Not very difficult here, folks.

The ever-steeper trial II
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : 3F of Eridanus, north of where Zouchouten is. You require

party will start with 1 MP.

How to complete : Talk to Koumokuten again and begin the battle.
He'll reduce all of your character's MP to 1 then begin.

                  with items as needed since you start with 1MP. He knows
                  Ziodyne and has weak physicals. Nothing to worry about.

cannot use any demons with more than 300 Max HP.

How to complete : I basically just went this solo. You can take low level
demons with parameter changing spells though, if you want.

                  Mostly physical. You could also put lower level demons with
                  debuffs/buffs into your party to help out, but I did it
                  with just my main character. He's easy.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Eridanus 3F, east of where Jikokuten is. Talk to Bishamonten
here. You can only acquire this EX Mission if your current
alignment is Chaos, but after it is in your mission log you
may freely switch to another alignment. The terms for his
fight are that your combined party levels have to be below 150. That includes you.

How to complete : The best way to get around the party level limit is of
course to go in by yourself with 1-2 demons, and begin
the battle using that party.

[ HP: 2000 / MP: 9999 ] > Wk: Fire / Nu: Ice, Expel, Curse <

                  Defeat Bishamonten. He isn't very difficult. He's weak to
                  Fire but since it'll likely just be you with one or two
                  demons, you're best off using whatever parameter changing
                  spells available and then auto battling or something.
                  He doesn't have much HP and only uses a weak random Ice
                  spell and rarely Hades Blast.

add up to less than 60.

How to complete : Accept the mission and then talk to Kazfiel to begin
the battle.

[ HP: 1800 / MP: 9999 ] > Wk: Elec / Nu: Wind, Expel, Curse ]

                  Use 1-2 demons here obviously so you can actually begin
                  the battle. Kazfiel knows Hades Blast (hit-all Phys),
                  Charge, Rakukaja and Garudyne.

                  If he uses Charge, you can try to throw up a Tetrakarn or
                  Attack Mirror in hopes that he'll use Hades Blast and
                  reflect enough damage to kill himself with, but it's not
                  really necessary to waste such a precious item on such an
                  easy battle.

Before the holy battle II
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Eridanus 3F, north of where Kazfiel is. You need
Gate Search C to get there. Talk to Aniel here and agree
to his battle terms, that you must defeat him in 7 turns.

How to complete : Talk to Aniel once the mission is accepted and choose to
begin your fight with him.

[ HP: 1700 / MP: 9999 ] > Wk: Wind / Nu: Elec, Expel, Curse <

                  Defeat Aniel in under 7 turns. Use your most powerful demons
                  and most powerful skills. Aniel is weak to Wind. This one's
                  easy to do as long as you're powerful enough as there's no
                  actual restrictions, just that you must win in 7 turns or
                  less to complete the EX Mission.

Reward : Plasma Sword. (Law only)

Before the holy battle III
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Eridanus 3F, north of where Aniel is. You need Unlock C
Main App to open the door. Talk to Kazfiel and Aniel here,
and agree to their terms, which are that your party's
average level must be below 45. The main character's level
does count towards this average. You must have completed
the previous two "Before the holy battle" EX Missions in
order for this to be available.

How to complete : Just use your main character with 1-2 good demons and some
low level demons with debuff/buff skills to bring the party
average level down to be able to begin the battle.

The holy dragonslayer
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Eridanus 3F. Talk to Kazfiel and Aniel after completing
"Before the holy battle III". Your current alignment must
be Law to acquire this EX Mission, however you may switch
alignment after it is in your Extra Misson log and simply
complete it whenever you wish. This is recommended if you
are going for an ending path that is not Law as the Fiend
you fight in this EX Mission stronger than most every
single boss in the game save the endgame and New Game+
extra bosses.

How to complete : Go through the door west of them and inspect the middle of
the room to fight the "dragon" for them. It's really the
fiend, Mother Harlot.

                  or physical weakness to fight her. She is the strongest
                  Fiend.

                  Luster Candy and Debilitate to the max and use spells like
                  Garudyne or Killing Wind with same-alignment demons to
                  trigger Co-Ops. She's Weak to wind as you may have guessed
                  by those recommended spells.

                  She knows Maziodyne, Mamudoon, her regular attack is quite
                  painful and when she gets low on health will begin to use
                  Babylon Goblet, her unique skill which does heavy almighty
                  damage and has a chance to charm those it hits.

                  The choice after the battle also affects your alignment if

                  • Finish them. (Law)
                  • Let them escape. (Chaos)

                  Go back and talk to Kazfiel and Aniel to get your
                  reward which is the best sword in the game, although
                  it is Law only. They'll give you the reward regardless
                  of what choice you made after the battle.

Reward : Ananomi Sword. (Law only)

Fateful aid
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Eridanus TOP Floor, in the northeast. You must have
previously done "The madness of Yggdrasil" EX Mission.
You will find Yggdrasil here, and when you inspect it,

Tales of investigation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Dantalian in the field in west Eridanus TOP floor.
He'll give you this mission. He's in the west part of the
floor. Hard to miss if you've explored the floor.

How to complete : Map out the floors of the areas that Dantalian requests.
They are... 1F of Bootes. 2F of Carina. 3F of Delphinus.

Reward : Bookmark. Turns into Sub App "MP regen II".

                  After finishing this EX Mission, you can talk to Dantalian
                  and he'll offer rewards for mapping individual floors of
                  dungeons. Macca at first, but if you're crazy enough to map
                  every single tile in the game in a single playthrough, you
                  will be rewarded with 5 of each stat Incense.

Fool eat meat!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Cerberus on Eridanus 2F. Requires Gate Search E to
get to him. He's in the northwest side of 2F, which you can
access from a gate-portal right near the central hub with
the terminal and heal spot.

How to complete : First, talk to Orthrus in a random encounter on Eridanus TOP
floor. Now, go back and talk to Cerberus on 2F.

                  Next, go to Antlia B2F and talk to Oni in a random encounter.

                  Go back to Cerberus on Eridanus 2F again, and then go to talk
                  to Orthrus in a random encounter on Eridanus TOP again.

                  Finally, report back to Cerberus on 2F again to complete.

Reward : Dauntless Ring. Horrible reward for all of that run-around.

Can you find my beloved horse?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Odin on 2F Eridanus will give this one. Requires Gate Search
E to get to him. He's in the northwest part of the map, sort
of near that central hub with the terminal and heal spot.
You have to go through a teleport maze north beyond where
Cerberus for the "Fool eat meat!" EX Mission was at, but it
is incredibly easy to navigate as all ends to it will drop
you right near where Odin hangs out.

How to complete : He wants you to give him his Sleipnir back. Just fuse a
Holy Sleipnir and hand it over. One working combination
is Beast Gryphon + Femme Atropos, both of which can be
recruited in Fornax.

Reward : Odin Ring.

Catch the rabbit!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Talk to Alice in the west part of Fornax B1F. She'll want
you to catch a rabbit so that she can play with it.
You must catch it within one moon cycle. Nulling Curse
by equipping some armor with Null Curse and some elemental
spells are recommended as you will have to fight Alice
and she is resistant to Phys and Gun type attacks.

How to complete : You have to move quick. From Alice's location, go to the
northwest through the one-way door, then go down the
stairs to B2F in the northeast.

                  On B2F, you'll meet the Rabbit. Once you turn south take
                  the first west and drop down the pit to the west.

                  On B3F, you'll meet the Rabbit again. Go east until you
                  turn, then search the east wall for a gate portal and go
                  on through it. Past the portal, go northeast and drop
                  down the pit.

                  On B4F, you will meet the Rabbit at the intersection.
                  Turn south at that point and go that direction to drop
                  down the pit to B5F.

                  On B5F, head north to the wall then go directly west
                  until you reach the dead end. If you did all of this in
                  under one moon cycle, you'll have cornered the rabbit.

                  Choose what you want during the following scene with
                  Alice and the rabbit, then you'll have to fight the
                  fiend, Alice.

                  main character as she has her unique skill, the most
                  powerful Curse-based instant kill spell "Die For Me!" which
                  has a base 80% chance of success against no resistance.

                  as possible before you fight her, he'll also throw in
                  [Bead Chain x1] for you for being a nice guy who saved him
                  from a crazy little ghost/demon girl. If you watched the
                  whole thing, he'll complain and you're not going to be

Evil's lingering shadow
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : First, this EX Mission is Law exclusive. You must have
chosen the Law path at the beginning of Horologium.
Done? First, head into Grus and phase shift over to
Sanctum A. From here, head to the room where you met
Mastema earlier and he transformed Zelenin. Here, you will
meet an archangel, who will tell you about a ritual taking
place in Horologium, and will mark your map.

                  In Horologium B6F, you need to go to that marker.
                  Angels will fuse into Seraph, who will offer this mission.

How to complete : Seraph tells you that a new demon of illusion is appearing
where you met Maya. So, yes, go to Grus and to the room
where you fought and killed Maya. You will now have to fight
Tyrant Mara.

                  have an open demon storage slot.

Mara's desire
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : First, this EX Mission is Chaos exclusive. You must have
chosen the Chaos path at the beginning of Horologium.
Done? Head into Grus and go to where Grendel is, he'll tell
about a powerful demon hanging out where Maya was in Grus.
Go to where you fought Maya and you'll meet the Tyrant Mara.

                  Mara will offer you a task. Accept it.

                  IF you chose to kill Grendel earlier during Grus' part of
                  the game by having Zelenin use her song or by outright
                  fighting him, simply head to the room where Maya was and
                  you'll meet Mara to begin this one.

How to complete : Go to Horologium B6F and to the spot that Mara has marked
on your map, choose to "Stop the ritual" and then defeat
Herald Seraph who shows up.

[ HP: 2200 / MP: 9999 ] > Wk: Ice / St: Phys, Gun / Nu: Expel, Curse / Dr: Fire <

                  Seraph uses Big Bang, the second most powerful attack in the
                  game, so you'll want to use some Luster Candy and Debilitate
                  to reduce damage to you to a managable level.
                  After you win, Mara shows up and rewards you.

                  ¯¯¯
                  • Herald Seraph fusion is unlocked.

Reward : • Tyrant Mara fusion is unlocked.

                  Mara gives you the promised Peacemaker (Chaos only Gun) and
                  she also offers to join you, which you can accept if you
                  have an open demon storage slot.

A measure of forever
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Horologium 1F, northwest area. Must go through the dark
areas in Horologium B1F to get there. Talk to Barong
on the field here.

How to complete : Meet Rangda in a random battle in say, Horologium B4F,
and talk to her. She'll give you Rangda Claw. Take it
back to Barong on 1F to complete this one.

Reward : Great Chakra x1.

> EX Missions: New Game+ <
> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mysterious device
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Antlia 1F. Inspect the green pillar device in the north
part of the floor before where the fairy village area is.
New Game+ only.

How to complete : Win some of the battles the machine will let you play.
These are the area bosses. You get rewards for each of
the bosses you kill, plus experience, plus the bosses
themselves drop items.

Reward : None. You can keep fighting them over and over again and
getting the individual rewards for defeating them, however.
This is a good way to level your main character fast if
you pull some great demons out of your compendium.

                  The order is Morax -> Mitra -> Horkos -> Asura
                  -> Ouroboros -> Tiamat -> Maya -> Mastema
                  -> Zelenin -> Jimenez -> Mem Aleph (both forms).

                  The bosses that appear depend on what paths you have
                  cleared on your file in previous playthroughs.

                  You'll always have Morax, Mitra, Horkos, Asura, Ouroboros,
                  Tiamat, and Maya. Ouroboros is the first form you fight
                  in Eridanus, with the regeneration effect.

                  Clearing the Law path adds Soil Jimenez and Mem Aleph, if
                  you haven't already gotten Mem Aleph from the Neutral path.

                  Clearing the Neutral path adds Mem Aleph, if you haven't
                  already gotten Mem Aleph from the Law path.

                  Clearing the Chaos path adds Mastema and Pillar Zelenin.

                  If you defeat them all within the turn limits you can
                  get Incense as a reward. If ALL demons are unlocked and
                  you defeat them all in the turn limits, you will receive
                  1 of every type of Incense every time you complete the
                  "boss rush" here within the turn limits.

The mother goddess' gravestone
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Where : Grus 1F Phase Shift Sanctum A. You know the place guarded
by an angel who'll just never let you pass? Well, in a new
game+/second cycle, a suspicious Strike Team member will
be there instead. If you have the Gate Search E and
Unlock E Main App functions, talk to this person to begin
this EX Mission.

How to complete : You need to go through the now-unlocked second half of Grus
behind that door that you'll now be able to pass. Refer to
the walkthrough's Grus East section for directions.
When you make it to to the northmost part of 1F via
traversing this part of Grus, you will have to fight Alilat.
Defeat her to finish this one.

                     ____________________
                    < Boss: Geist Alilat >
                     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                    [ HP: 3500 / MP: 9999 ]
                    > St: Phys / Nu: Gun, Expel, Curse <

                  One of the optional New Game+ bosses. Only elemental and
                  almighty are going to do you any good here against Alilat.
                  Alilat herself only has four actions. A regular attack,
                  Megidolaon, Concentrate, and Diarahan. Yes, Diarahan.
                  A full freaking heal. She only has about 3500 HP, though.

                  You'll want to begin the fight concentrating on buffs and
                  debuffs. Luster Candy and Debilitate or Jihad.
                  The Megidolaon may hurt so I recommend spamming Mediarahan
                  or Salvation with one demon pretty much every round, or
                  using a Bead Chain if you end a round with too little HP.

                  At +3/-3 buff status, the Megidolaon shouldn't hurt too
                  much unless Alilat uses Concentrate, in which case you may
                  want to guard if your HPs aren't dangerously low and you'd
                  need to prioritize healing.

                  The way to win this fight is basically to slam her with
                  very high level demons with Jihad, Big Bang, Megidolaon or
                  Element + Amp spells. There really isn't much strategy
                  involved. If you've got high enough level demons with
                  Jihad, you can probably end this fight in a round or two
                  of spamming it. You'll certainly need such demons for the
                  next EX Mission.

                  ¯¯¯
                  • Geist Alilat fusion is unlocked.

Reward : Rare Forma "Nabatea Stone". Transforms into Sub App
"Scanning Zero" which allows you to see dark areas
on your automap, and ties into the next EX Mission,
False god in chains.

                  Accepting the False god in chains EX Mission will
                  change your alignment a bit towards Law if you have not
                  already gotten past the point in the game where your
                  alignment is locked.

False god in chains
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Where : Grus 1F Phase Shift Sanctum A. After defeating Alilat in the
EX Mission "The mother goddess' gravestone", an angel who
appears to be Metatron will ask for your help. Should you
accept, you will be put onto this EX Mission. Again, this is
obviously New Game+/second cycle only.

How to complete : You need to go through B3F of Grus' east area, unlocking the
hidden doors and doing a hell of a lot of backtracking and
manipulation of the phase shifter to get to the elevator.
The elevator leads down to B4F. On B4F, you can fight the
ultimate boss of the game, Demiurge. Doing so will complete
this EX Mission. Refer to the Grus East section of the
walkthrough for details in navigating the dungeon to reach
Demiurge, and demon passwords if you lack really strong
demons, which you will need.

                  You need the Enemy Search C Main App to actually fight him.

               > Wk: Wind / Nu: Expel, Curse / Rf: Phys, Gun, Fire, Ice, Elec <

                  Yes... serious business here. Very serious business indeed.

                  Demiurge is by far the strongest boss in the game. This is
                  why I suggest the powerful demons, level 99 and good
                  equipment for an easy time. You can only reliably damage him
                  with Almighty attacks. He effectively reflects and nulls all
                  of the rest of them regularly to the point where you'd have
                  to build a team that covers all elements on most demons for
                  any kind of efficiency approaching just spamming the same
                  one or two Almighty attacks. Sad, but true.

                  The strategy is basically to buff up with Luster Candy to +3
                  and spam Jihad, while using restoratives on your main
                  character. Begin by using a Tetraja Stone on your main
                  character to prevent any instant-kills via Mahamaon or
                  Mamudoon and if he uses one of those spells, use another
                  Tetraja Stone. In any case, your main character isn't going
                  to cause any kind of significant damage here unless you did
                  the Mysterious device to farm Incense via the boss rush to
                  up him to 99 all stats or something.
                  That isn't needed, though.

                  As an alternative to Jihad you could also Debilitate him to
                  -3 and then use Big Bang or other almighty skills like
                  Babylon Goblet, Megidolaon, etc. Big Bang only costs 10
                  less MP than Jihad and the only benefit you'll see is that
                  he deals less damage to you on the turns that he does attack
                  due to the constant -3 to his attack.

                  Even if you did max your MC's stats out, he can't compare to
                  Jihad-using 90+ Ma demons. Use him to throw items to heal
                  the party and replenish party MP.

                  Demiurge will spend many of his turns using Dekunda with the
                  Jihad strategy, to remove Jihad's debuffs. He'll spend a
                  few using Diarama which heals him for 900-1200, and your
                  damage output with my password demons will be insane, should
                  you choose to use them. You should only need 1 or 2 Great
                  Chakras or Beads of Life to beat him into submission if you
                  use those demons.

                  If using lesser demons with 60s, 70s or otherwise below 80
                  Ma, it will take you much longer to defeat him. Much, much
                  longer. And you'll need more items to heal with, too.
                  Anyway, spam him down with almighty and items, that's
                  basically all there is to it. The hardest part is of course
                  getting a party capable of doing it. A decent amount of
                  grinding is needed. Nowhere near as much as say, Digital
                  Devil Saga ultimate bosses, but still quite a bit.

                  His attacks include Big Bang, Mamudoon, Mahamaon, Agi Gate,
                  Bufu Gate, Zio Gate, Garu Gate, Luster Candy, Dekunda,
                  and that Disaster Cycle attack that was first seen on
                  Ouroboros and then reused on a few other bosses. But really,
                  you'll probably never even see half of them if you're Jihad
                  spamming him.

                  ¯¯¯

> Main Character's Gun Skills <
> ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
> Despite many of the main character's gun skills such as "Gust Shot" for
> example which is a Wind attribute attack being a magic property, all of the
> main character's Gun skills are affected in power by one thing:

The Main Character's Gun Attack Power stat. This is only increased by...

• A higher Attack Power gun.
• His St (Strength) stat.

Ma does not factor into the damage calculations at all. It is due to this
that the Power value of a skill is not all you should consider when picking
a Gun to do damage using its skills. Unless you are using a Gun's skills to
trigger Co-Ops via weakness exploitation, you are almost universally better
off using the highest Attack Power gun with desired skills that you can get
your hands on.

That aside, here's a list of all of the gun skills, sorted by attribute type.

/******************\*\*******************\_******************\*\*******************\
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

This is a listing of the enemy data displayed in the
Demon Data -> Demon Analysis menu in the game.

This is NOT a listing of the stats of every demon you can get in the game.
Basically, these are the demons as you encounter them in random encounters,
and many demons are fusion only or special encounters that don't show up on
this list at all.

The stats and skills of these demons differ from when you recruit them.
Enemies marked with a "\*" next to their personality cannot be negotiated
with. They are Enemy Search-only demons.

It's sorted by the default "By Race" sorting the game uses.
